"WASHINGTON — The Internal Revenue Service official who first disclosed that the agency had targeted conservative groups for special scrutiny, and in doing so ignited a controversy that has ensnared the White House, denied on Wednesday that she had ever provided false information to Congress.As the official, Lois Lerner, appeared under subpoena before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, she sternly told her questioners that accusations that she had misled Congress in previous testimony were false.“I have not done anything wrong.Ms. Lerner has become a person of intense interest to Congressional investigators, who insist that she made, at best, incomplete statements when she said she first learned that her subordinates had singled out Tea Party groups after reading news media reports last year.After she refused on Wednesday to say anything more to the committee, despite attempts by Representative Darrell Issa of California, the committee’s Republican chairman, to persuade her otherwise, Mr. Issa tried to dismiss her and her lawyer.“You don’t get to tell your side of the story and then not be subjected to cross-examination,” said Representative Trey Gowdy of South Carolina.Mr. Issa made a second attempt to persuade her to change her mind.That exchange set the tone for a contentious hearing that veered into veiled accusations that the White House had a larger role in the controversy than previously disclosed, as well as outright attacks on President Obama’s character.Mr. Issa said he reserved the right to recall Ms. Lerner later.The committee also heard testimony from Douglas H. Shulman, the former I.R.S. commissioner; Neal S. Wolin, the deputy secretary of the Treasury Department; and J. Russell George, the Treasury inspector general who looked into the accusations of targeting.“The power to tax is the power to destroy,” Mr. Issa said.Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the senior Democrat on the committee, also scolded the agency.But Mr. Cummings also admonished his Republican colleagues.The hearing, the second this week on the I.R.S.’s efforts to target conservative groups, offered few new revelations.At times, committee members could hardly conceal their contempt for the I.R.S. and the Obama White House.Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, tried to link the I.R.S. scandal with other controversies that are dogging the Obama administration.“This administration, which told us and told the American people that the attack that killed four Americans in Benghazi was the work, was caused by a video, is now the same administration who expects us to believe that this scandal was just the result of two rogue agents in Cincinnati,” he said.Representative James Lankford, Republican of Oklahoma, said the way that applicants for tax-exempt status were buried in I.R.S. paperwork reminded him of another sore point that Republicans have with the Obama administration.“Man, that sounds like the Keystone Pipeline to me,” he said, referring to the proposed cross-country oil pipeline that the president has so far declined to approve.One Democrat, Representative Stephen F. Lynch of Massachusetts, even raised the threat of appointing a special prosecutor if Congress continues to feel that the I.R.S. is not being straightforward.“We know where that will lead. It will lead to a special prosecutor,” he said.Later, Mr. Jordan pressed Mr. Shulman, the former I.R.S. commissioner, on whether he had visited the White House.“One hundred-eighteen visits and it didn’t come up in casual conversation?” Mr. Jordan said.In follow-up questioning by Representative Gerald E. Connolly, a Virginia Democrat, Mr. Shulman offered what he said was one of the many plausible explanations why he would have visited the White House.",center
"Obama Willing to Use Executive Orders on GunsWASHINGTON — President Obama this week will embrace a comprehensive plan to reduce gun violence that will call for major legislation to expand background checks for gun purchases and lay out 19 separate actions the president could take by invoking the power of his office, lawmakers who were briefed on the plan said Monday.Lawmakers and other officials said that the president could use a public event as soon as Wednesday to signal his intention to engage in the biggest Congressional fight over guns in nearly two decades, focusing on the heightened background checks and including efforts to ban assault weapons and their high-capacity clips.Actions the president could take on his own are likely to include imposing new limits on guns imported from overseas, compelling federal agencies to improve sharing of mental health records and directing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct research on gun violence, according to those briefed on the effort.White House aides believe Mr. Obama can also ratchet up enforcement of existing laws, including tougher prosecution of people who lie on their background checks.At a news conference on Monday, exactly one month after the school massacre in Newtown, Conn., Mr. Obama said a task force led by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. had “presented me now with a list of sensible, common-sense steps that can be taken to make sure that the kinds of violence we saw at Newtown doesn’t happen again.The administration’s strategy reflects the uncertainty of gun politics in America and the desire by White House officials to address the Connecticut shooting while also confronting the broader deficiencies in the country’s criminal justice and mental health systems.By proposing to use the independent power of his office, Mr. Obama is inviting political attacks by gun owners who have already expressed fear that he will abuse that authority to restrict their rights.White House officials and Democratic lawmakers said that there are clear limits to what the president can and cannot do, and that Mr. Obama has no plans to push beyond what he would need Congressional authority to accomplish.On Capitol Hill, Mr. Obama’s legislative effort will face intense opposition from gun rights groups, including the National Rifle Association, and the lawmakers they support with millions of dollars at election time and who see gun rights as a defining issue in their districts.“He’s putting together a pretty comprehensive list of what could be done to make a difference in this area,” said Representative Mike Thompson of California, who is heading a Democratic task force in the House.Representative Jackie Speier, Democrat of California, said Vice President Biden had informed lawmakers during a two-hour briefing on Monday that there are “19 independent steps that the president can take by executive order.”Rahm Emanuel, the mayor of Chicago and Mr. Obama’s former chief of staff, joined the debate on Monday and said that the president should “clear the table” by doing whatever he can administratively so small issues do not get in the way of the bigger legislative fights over access to guns.“Don’t allow a side issue to derail these things,” Mr. Emanuel said during a discussion about gun policy.“The assault-weapons ban is a low priority relative to the other measures the Biden task force is considering,” Matt Bennett, a spokesman for Third Way, a left-leaning research group, said after hearing from Mr. Biden last week.Any efforts to get gun legislation through Congress will require an enormous and ceaseless pressure campaign by the administration.Scores of senators, including many Democrats, will be wary of voting on any effort to curb access to guns or ammunition.With fiscal issues continuing to dominate the political calendar for the next several weeks, White House officials and lawmakers say the gun safety effort is likely to be debated in separate pieces of legislation that could be introduced over time.",center
"Mary Cheney, the younger sister of Liz Cheney, a Wyoming Senate candidate, sharply criticized her sister’s stance on same-sex marriage and urged her own Facebook friends to share the message.Posting on Facebook on Friday evening, Mary Cheney, who is gay and married her longtime partner last year, wrote: “For the record, I love my sister, but she is dead wrong on the issue of marriage.”Their father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, supports same-sex marriage, and the younger Cheney echoed some of his language on the issue when she added, “Freedom means freedom for everyone.”“That means that all families — regardless of how they look or how they are made — all families are entitled to the same rights, privileges and protections as every other,” Mary Cheney wrote.Earlier Friday, Liz Cheney revealed her position on same-sex marriage, a topic she has kept relatively quiet about since declaring her candidacy in July against incumbent Senator Mike Enzi, Republican of Wyoming.“I am not pro-gay marriage,” Liz Cheney said in a statement responding to an apparent push poll against her in Wyoming.That position — deferring to the will of the voters on a state-by-state basis — may represent something of a compromise between total support or opposition.“It’s not something to be decided by a show of hands,” Mary Cheney wrote.And to emphasize that she was not shying away from drawing attention to her view, Mary Cheney concluded her Facebook post: “Please like and share if you agree.”In an e-mail, Mary Cheney declined to comment further on her sister’s position, saying she would let her Facebook post speak for itself.The Cheney family dispute mirrors the broader disagreement among Republicans on same-sex marriage.Liz Cheney’s stance underlines the degree to which full-throated support for same-sex marriage, even in a libertarian-leaning state like Wyoming, still poses a political risk in a Republican primary.Mr. Enzi opposes legalizing same-sex marriage.",center
"WASHINGTON — The Obama administration tried Saturday to marshal new evidence in defense of its collection of private Internet and telephone data, arguing that a secret program called Prism is simply an “internal government computer system” designed to sort through court-supervised collection of data, and that Congress has been briefed 13 times on the programs since 2009.After rushing to declassify some carefully selected descriptions of the programs, James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, conceded for the first time that the Prism program existed.Mr. Clapper also insisted that the government “does not unilaterally obtain information from the servers” of telephone and Internet providers, saying that information is turned over only under court order, when there is a “documented, foreign intelligence purpose for acquisition” of the data.He appeared to be attempting to push back against early reports that the government had direct access to the huge computer servers at Google, Microsoft, Facebook and similar companies.But they acknowledge handing over material when ordered to do so by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, though they have not described the mechanism for complying with those orders.The national intelligence director’s rare Saturday statement was notable for what it omitted: any description of other means the government may use to intercept Internet information directly from fiber optic cables or satellite systems even before or after it reaches those Internet companies.A new report in The Guardian, published online on Saturday, cited another document that showed that in March 2013 there were 97 billion pieces of data collected from networks worldwide; about 14 percent of it was from Iran, much was from Pakistan and about 3 percent came from inside the United States, though some of that may have been foreign data traffic routed through American-based servers.Meanwhile, senior Obama administration officials, including the directors of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and of national intelligence, have held 13 classified hearings and briefings for members of Congress since 2009 to explain the broad authority they say they have to sweep up electronic records for national security purposes, a senior administration official said Saturday.The administration, by disclosing the briefings, sought to push back on claims by Democrats and Republicans in Congress that they were either not aware of programs to mine vast amounts of Internet data and business telephone records or were insufficiently briefed on the details.Lawmakers said that what they knew was vague and broad — and that strict rules of classification prevented them from truly debating the programs or conducting proper oversight.In separate but identical letters sent on Oct. 19, 2011, Assistant Attorney General Ronald Weich told two of Congress’s most outspoken critics of the efforts, Senators Ron Wyden of Oregon and Mark Udall of Colorado, both Democrats, that in December 2009 and February 2011 the Justice Department and intelligence agencies provided a classified document to Congress describing the surveillance efforts in detail.The letter said the House and Senate Intelligence Committees had been briefed “on these operations multiple times and have had access to copies of the classified” orders and opinions of the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.Broader briefings were held in 2011 before the reauthorization of the Patriot Act, the post-Sept. 11 law that authorized much of the surveillance.“Against this backdrop, we do not believe the executive branch is operating pursuant to ‘secret law’ or ‘secret opinions of the Department of Justice,’ ” Mr. Weich wrote.On Friday, Mr. Udall and Mr. Wyden released a joint statement repeating that they had “long been concerned about the degree to which this collection has relied on ‘secret law.’ ”“Senior administration officials have stated on multiple occasions that the Patriot Act’s ‘business records’ authority is ‘analogous to a grand jury subpoena,’ ” they said.“Now that the fact of bulk collection has been declassified, we believe that more information about the scale of the collection, and specifically whether it involves the records of ‘millions of Americans,’ should be declassified as well,” they said.The list of briefings begins on May 12, 2009, with a classified hearing of the Senate Intelligence Committee involving Gen. Keith B. Alexander, the head of the United States Cyber Command, and David S. Kris, assistant attorney general for national security.On Feb. 14, 2011, all senators were offered the opportunity to discuss the broad authority under the Patriot Act with the director of national intelligence, Mr. Clapper; the F.B.I. director, Robert S. Mueller III; and General Alexander.On Feb. 8, 2011, Senators Dianne Feinstein of California, the chairwoman of the Intelligence Committee, and Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, the ranking Republican on the panel, invited every senator to a briefing with Mr. Clapper and Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. to discuss expiring provisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978.The provisions — “one on roving authority for electronic surveillance and the other on the acquisition of business records that are relevant to investigations to protect against international terrorism or espionage” — were added to the 1978 law by the Patriot Act.But Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the Senate’s No. 2 Democrat, draws a distinction between the holding of such briefings and the informed consent of Congress.“You can count on two hands the number of people in Congress who really know,” he said in an interview on Friday.",center
"Lois Lerner, the director of the exempt organizations unit at the Internal Revenue Service, plans to invoke the Fifth Amendment during her expected testimony before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on Wednesday, the Los Angeles Times reports.Lerner announced her plans to plead the Fifth during her testimony in a letter from her lawyer, William Taylor III, to the committee.Since she will be pleading the Fifth, Taylor has asked the committee that she be excused from testifying.The Wednesday hearing would have been Lerner's first public appearance, and first under oath, since she apologized for the IRS' inappropriate targeting of conservative groups at a May 10 American Bar Association meeting.Issa has issued a subpoena to compel Lerner to appear at the hearing.Lerner is a key figure in the unfolding IRS scandal.According to the report issued by the Department of the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, Lerner had to correct the criteria developed by the Cincinnati office twice because she and other top IRS officials found that they were using politically fraught terms as they sought to make sure groups were properly applying for tax exemption.Lerner's decision to plead the Fifth comes as the Department of Justice has initiated an investigation into whether laws were broken at the IRS, according to Taylor's letter to the committee.“The Committee has been contacted by Ms. Lerner’s lawyer who stated that his client intended to invoke her 5th amendment right and refuse to answer questions,” Oversight and Government Reform Committee spokesman Ali Ahmad said in a statement.",center
"WASHINGTON -- Former Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. (D-Ill.) pleaded guilty in a federal courtroom Wednesday morning to using campaign funds to purchase an array of personal items including Bruce Lee memorabilia, a $43,000 Rolex watch and a mink cashmere cape.He pleaded guilty to conspiracy before U.S. District Judge Robert L. Wilkins.Jackson, dressed in a blue tie, blue shirt and a blue suit, looked back in the direction of his father and wife several times during the hearing.Jackson said he was clearheaded and had not been under treatment for alcohol or drug abuse, though he did have a beer last night.He acknowledged he ""used money that shouldn't have been used,"" calling the government's statement accurate and saying he had ""no interest in wasting the taxpayers' time or money.""The judge set the sentencing for June 28 at 2 p.m. Jackson will be free to go after he surrenders his passport, and will be restricted to living in the D.C. or Chicago area.The former national co-chairman of President Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign, Jackson was first elected to office in 1995 and resigned from Congress last year amid a federal investigation and his treatment for bipolar disorder.In a statement issued by his lawyers on Friday after court records indicated he planned a guilty plea, Jackson said he had “no excuses” for his conduct and “fully accept my responsibility for the improper decisions and mistakes I have made.”UPDATE 2:52 p.m. -- Additional records disclosed Wednesday revealed that expenses charged by Jackson and his wife to his campaign included $4,272.78 on the Navigator of the Seas cruise, $2,306.08 at Walt Disney World, over $10,000 at Best Buy, over $300 at Build-A-Bear, $3,544.00 at Mariel's Boutique, and $5,687.75 on Martha's Vineyard Holistic Retreat.",right
"Republicans challenge Clinton claims on budget cuts, Benghazi cableRepublicans are challenging a host of statements made by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Democratic allies during Wednesday's heated Libya testimony -- claiming that complaints about a lack of funding are bogus and questioning the secretary's insistence she never saw urgent cables warning about the danger of an attack.The questions come as the Senate Foreign Relations Committee begins its confirmation hearing for Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., who was tapped to replace Clinton at the department.One issue that may come up is the department's funding.""Shame on the House for ... failing to adequately fund the administration's request,"" Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., saidClinton, in turn, affirmed their claims, saying budget issues are a ""bipartisan problem.""Budget numbers, though, actually show the overall diplomatic security budget has ballooned over the past decade.Democrats point to modest decreases in funding in recent years, and the fact that Congress has approved less than was requested.And the complaints tend to overlook the fact that the overall security budget has more than doubled since fiscal 2004.For that year, the budget was $640 million.Slightly more has been requested for fiscal 2013.It's difficult to tell how much was specifically allocated for Benghazi.Slightly more has been requested for fiscal 2013.Still, then-Deputy Assistant Secretary for Diplomatic Security Charlene Lamb testified in October that the size of the attack -- and not the money -- was the issue.Asked if there was any budget consideration that led her not to increase the security force, she said: ""No.""She added: ""This was an unprecedented attack in size.""Asked Wednesday about Lamb's testimony, Clinton noted that the review board that examined the Libya attack found budget issues have played a role.""That's why you have an independent group like an (Accountability Review Board); that's why it was created to look at everything,"" Clinton said.But Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., said ""any suggestion that this is a budget issue is off base, or political.""Other lawmakers further complained that the State Department has spent millions on lower-priority projects that could have been spent on security.Another pivotal issue Wednesday dealt with an Aug. 16 cable.That cable is seen as one of the vital warnings sent out of Libya in the months leading up to the attack.""That cable did not come to my attention.Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, said ""somebody within your office should have seen this cable.""""An emergency meeting was held and a cable sent out on Aug. 16 by the ambassador himself, warning of what could happen.Clinton said it was ""very disappointing"" that ""inadequacies"" were found in the ""responsiveness of our team here in Washington,"" and said ""it's something we're fixing and intend to put into place protocols and systems to make sure it doesn't happen again.""The secretary tried to explain that ""1.43 million cables"" come through the department every year.Republicans argue the Aug. 16 cable was rather high priority.""Had I been president at the time, and I found that you did not read the cables from Benghazi, you did not read the cables from Ambassador Stevens, I would have relieved you of your post.",center
"NRA School Safety Report Recommends Arming Teachers, Loosening Gun LawsWASHINGTON -- Former Rep. Asa Hutchinson (R-Ark.) on Tuesday released a 225-page report on school safety funded by the National Rifle Association.The report was prepared by a 12-person task force, called the School Shield Program, led by Hutchinson.""Teachers should teach, but if there is personnel that has interest and is willing to go through 40 to 60 hours of [firearms] training, then schools should be willing to [arm them],"" Hutchinson said.The task force recommended that schools designate willing staff to be armed and trained, and it proposed a model training program, 40-60 hours per person, at what Hutchinson said would be a cost of about $800 to $1,000 per trained employee.The committee didn't recommend any specific kind of firearm for school security, Hutchinson said, adding, ""Everything from a sidearm, to a shotgun, to an AR-15"" would work.The task force also suggested that states loosen current legal restrictions on who can carry a firearm on school property.Other recommendations included creating threat assessment teams at schools, better coordinating state and federal funding for school security, and offering an online assessment tool, so that administrators can evaluate their schools' potential security gaps.Hutchinson's report and his press conference were both met with scathing criticism from the American Federation of Teachers, which supports broader gun control measures and strongly opposes arming educators.The NRA also put out a statement on the report, over which the gun lobby insists it had no influence.The report marks the culmination of a controversial process that began in December, when NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre held a press conference the week after the shooting in Newtown, Conn.Hutchinson said Tuesday that the idea of armed volunteers was scrapped after it was met with ""great reluctance"" from school employees.Asked about the current debate in Congress over gun control legislation, Hutchinson said he had ""not dealt with the separate debate"" because he had been too busy considering school safety issues.He did, however, weigh in on state gun control efforts currently being debated in Connecticut, which include a ban on high-capacity magazines and a broader assault weapons ban.""You can address assault weapons, but it doesn't stop violence in schools.Hutchinson also encouraged the NRA to continue funding pilot programs to train school employees to carry weapons.When he had finished introducing the report, Hutchinson called up Mark Mattioli, whose 6-year-old son, James Mattioli, was killed in December along with 19 other children at Sandy Hook Elementary School.",center
"Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick on Wednesday picked a former chief of staff to fill Sen.

Stephen F. Lynch, Michael E. Capuano and Edward Markey.The most high-profile potential Republican candidate is former Sen. Scott Brown, who pulled off a surprise 2010 victory in the race for the open seat of Sen. Ted Kennedy.Cowan joined the Patrick administration in 2009 and reportedly quit earlier this month to join private practice.Cowan is a graduate of Duke University and Northeastern University School of Law.“I am confident this is the right and best choice,” Patrick said at a late-morning press conference.The appointment marks the first time in Senate history that two black senators have served at the same time.“I’m not standing here because I’m a person of color, but because (the governor) believes I can do the job,” said Cowen, who joins South Carolina Republican Sen. Tim Scott as the chamber’s two black senators.Cowmen also emphasized that his assignment is “temporary” and that he will work together with Kerry’s team.Patrick gave little indication who he favored during his deliberations.The only possible candidate he confirmed speaking with was former Democratic Rep.

Kennedy’s widow, had also been mentioned as possible candidates for the interim post.",right
"WASHINGTON — E-mails released by the White House on Wednesday revealed a fierce internal jostling over the government’s official talking points in the aftermath of last September’s attack in Benghazi, Libya, not only between the State Department and the Central Intelligence Agency, but at the highest levels of the C.I.A.The 100 pages of e-mails showed a disagreement between David H. Petraeus, then the director of the C.I.A., and his deputy, Michael J. Morell, over how much to disclose in the talking points, which were used by Susan E. Rice, the ambassador to the United Nations, in television appearances days after the attack.Mr. Morell, administration officials said, deleted a reference in the draft version of the talking points to C.I.A. warnings of extremist threats in Libya, which State Department officials objected to because they feared it would reflect badly on them.Mr. Morell, officials said, acted on his own and not in response to pressure from the State Department.“This is certainly not what Vice Chairman Ruppersberger was hoping to get,” Mr. Petraeus wrote, referring to Representative C. A. Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, which had asked Mr. Petraeus for talking points to use with reporters in discussing the attack on Benghazi.The White House released the e-mails to reporters after Republicans seized on snippets of the correspondence that became public on Friday to suggest that President Obama’s national security staff had been complicit in trying to alter the talking points for political reasons.While the e-mails portrayed White House officials as being sensitive to the concerns of the State Department, they suggest that Mr. Obama’s aides mostly mediated a bureaucratic tug of war between the State Department and the C.I.A. over how much to disclose — all under heavy time constraints because of the demands from Capitol Hill.“In recent days, these e-mails have been selectively and inaccurately read out to the media,” said a White House spokesman, Eric Schultz.Still, the final version of the talking points is stripped of material — including a reference to Libya being awash with weapons and fighters that made it a dangerous environment — which critics say would have raised questions about the State Department’s security posture.Republicans welcomed the release of the e-mails, saying they confirmed that the administration had airbrushed its account of the attack during an election campaign.“The seemingly political nature of the State Department’s concerns raises questions about the motivations behind these changes and who at the State Department was seeking them,” said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for Speaker John A. Boehner.In releasing the e-mails, the White House was hoping to show that intelligence officials, not political advisers, drove the debate over the talking points.But there is no other evidence in the e-mails that Mr. Morell himself objected to the inclusion of this material.The release of the e-mails offers a rare glimpse inside the White House five days after the attack as it struggled to piece together intelligence to formulate a public account of what happened.The process began in earnest at 4:20 p.m. on Friday, Sept. 14, when Stephen W. Preston, the C.I.A. general counsel, sent an e-mail to other agency officials warning them not to disclose information that might interfere with the F.B.I.’s investigation.At 6:20 p.m., the spokesman for the National Security Council at the time, Tommy Vietor, e-mailed to remind officials that Denis McDonough, then the deputy national security adviser and now the White House chief of staff, wanted to ensure that the edits were coordinated with the State Department.At 6:41 p.m., Shawn Turner, the spokesman for the director of national intelligence, suggested saying that on Sept. 10, the C.I.A. had “notified” the American embassy in Cairo, not “warned” it, of social media reports calling for a demonstration and encouraging jihadists to break into the embassy.At 7:16 p.m., Victoria Nuland, the State Department spokeswoman, weighed in with her initial concerns about ensuring that the talking points provided to lawmakers did not go further than what the administration was telling reporters.Twenty-three minutes later, Ms. Nuland sent White House and intelligence officials an even more pointed e-mail, objecting that the talking points could be “abused” by lawmakers “to beat the State Department for not paying attention to agency warnings so why do we want to feed that either? Concerned ... ”At 7:51 p.m., the F.B.I. offered only minor changes to the draft, the bureau’s only suggestions during the contentious process.At 9:24 p.m., Ms. Nuland, reading the latest draft, complained in an e-mail, “These don’t resolve all my issues or those of my building leadership.”In a report that set off the latest tempest over the talking points, ABC News reported incorrectly that Mr. Rhodes had emphasized the need to protect the State Department’s interests.At 9:52 p.m., a C.I.A. spokesman e-mailed to other agency staff members a draft note intended for Mr. Petraeus, warning him that while the White House had quickly cleared the proposed talking points, the State Department had “major concerns.”Mr. Obama’s national security deputies reviewed the talking points at a meeting the next day, Sept. 15, Mr. Rhodes said.At 11:25 a.m., Mr. Rhodes changed a reference to the United States “consulate” in Benghazi to “diplomatic post.”Over the next couple of hours, aides made small final changes and e-mailed a final version to lawmakers shortly after 3 p.m.With time short before Ms. Rice began taping her appearances on Sunday morning news programs, the White House also supplied her aides with the final talking points.Asked by one of Ms. Rice’s aides, “Is this the final language you want to use on Benghazi,” Mr. Rhodes replied with a single word: “Yup.”",left
"WASHINGTON – Legally married same-sex couples will now be allowed to file federal joint tax returns, the IRS and Treasury Department announced Thursday.Thursday’s announcement comes on the heels of a historic decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, which overturned a part of the Defense of Marriage Act earlier this year.Questions were raised following the high court’s decision on how the federal government would treat same-sex couples whose home states don’t recognize gay marriage.The rules issued Thursday said the policies would affect all legally married gay couples regardless of where they live.""Today's ruling provides certainty and clear, coherent tax filing guidance for all legally married same-sex couples nationwide.Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin said that, because of today’s ruling, “committed and loving gay and lesbian married couples will now be treated equally under our nation’s federal tax laws, regardless of what state they call home.”He added, “These families finally have access to crucial tax benefits and protections previously denied to them under the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act.”Not everyone was on board with the decision.Brian Brown, president of the National Organization of Marriage, believes that giving same sex couples the right to file jointly “continues a pattern of lawlessness” across the country.""The Obama administration is intent on forcing same-sex 'marriage' on an unwilling public,"" Brown said in a written statement.",right
"The resurgent controversy over the Obama administration's initial story-line on the Benghazi attack underscores State Department concerns about the leadership's failure to act on documented warnings and security incidents.Draft ""talking points"" obtained by The Weekly Standard and ABC News depicted efforts by State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland in the days after the attack to strip out references to prior attacks in Benghazi.During a press conference Monday, President Obama even acknowledged that the country now knows that ""clearly (the staff in Benghazi) were not in a position where they were adequately protected.""A review of now-public State Department records as well as a classified State Department cable, first reviewed and reported by Fox News, shows a steady stream of documented warnings to Washington from intelligence and State security officials on the ground in Libya that the Islamist threat was severe and growing.One of the most significant warnings was an August 2012 State Department classified cable, which has not been made public, that summarized an emergency meeting in Benghazi where the CIA briefed on the significant threat of terrorist activity.The cable, sent under Ambassador Chris Stevens' signature and marked SECRET, warned the office of Secretary of State Clinton that the CIA advised ""ten Islamist militias and AQ training camps (were) within Benghazi.""The cable also warned that the 17 February Brigade, the group charged with protecting the consulate, appeared to be compromised.In addition to identifying the presence of Al Qaeda and Ansar al-Sharia in Benghazi, the groups ultimately blamed for the assault, a key section of the cable, which remains classified, seemed to foreshadow the attack itself.""RSO (Regional Security Officer) expressed concerns with the ability to defend Post in the event of a coordinated attack due to limited manpower, security measures, weapons capabilities, host nation support, and the overall size of the compound,"" it said.During congressional hearings in January, Clinton was asked whether she had seen the cable by Republican Rep. Michael McCaul.""Congressman, that cable did not come to my attention,"" Clinton testified before the House Foreign Affairs committee.In February, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham followed up on the classified cable.After the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff confirmed he knew about the cable which summarized the August emergency meeting in Benghazi, Graham questioned why the military was read in when Clinton apparently was not.Gen. Martin Dempsey responded: ""Well, I don't know that she didn't know about the cable.""Graham said: ""She said she didn't. Are you stunned that she didn't?""Dempsey said: ""I would call myself surprised that she didn't.""In addition to attacks in Benghazi on the British ambassador -- which forced the temporary closure of the U.K. operation -- the International Red Cross and United Nations, in the summer of 2012 the group Ansar al-Sharia was so well-established it held an annual conference in Benghazi to promote Islamic law.Records released by the House oversight committee, including a report from the regional security officer, also documented more than 200 cases of violence in Libya in the year leading up to the attack, specifically between June 2011 and July 2012.While much has been made of the State Department's failure to respond to repeated security requests for extra help, a former diplomatic security agent and 20-year veteran of the department, who reviewed the publicly available documents on the condition of anonymity, told Fox News the multiple warnings present a compelling argument that State Department leadership was negligent.The State Department, in a document put out last week, noted that while an internal review found certain senior officials ""demonstrated a lack of proactive leadership and management ability"" in response to security concerns, there was no specific finding of misconduct.",center
"Site Mobile NavigationGovernor Appoints Ex-Aide to Fill Kerry’s SeatBOSTON — Gov. Deval Patrick on Wednesday appointed William Cowan, a Boston lawyer who is a longtime friend and former aide, to serve as an interim United States senator until voters chose a successor to John Kerry in a special election set for June 25.Mr. Cowan, 43, who is known as Mo, is a former partner in the politically connected law firm of Mintz Levin and will become Massachusetts’ first black senator since Edward Brooke, a Republican, held the seat from 1966 to 1978.Mr. Patrick had said he wanted to appoint someone who did not want to run for the seat later because that person would have to conduct a campaign while learning the ropes in the Senate, and would be unlikely to do either job well.The clock is now ticking toward the special election.The biggest question remaining in this drawn-out episode, which began last fall when Mr. Kerry’s name surfaced as a possible successor to Hillary Rodham Clinton as secretary of state, is whether former Senator Scott P. Brown, a Republican, will jump in.Mr. Brown has remained mum on the subject, and his camp has sent few signals about his intentions, but he may find the opportunity hard to resist.Polls show him beating Representative Edward J. Markey, the only Democrat who has officially declared his candidacy.If he entered the race and won, Mr. Brown would be in the awkward position of becoming the junior senator to Ms. Warren, even though she has been in office only a few weeks.Still, it would be unusual for a state to have two senators who had run against each other, especially in a race that was particularly hard fought.The June 25 special election would be Mr. Brown’s third statewide Senate race in three years, starting with his win in a special election in January 2010 to finish Senator Edward M. Kennedy’s term.So far, the only Democrat in the race is Mr. Markey, 66, a liberal and dean of the state’s Congressional delegation.But Representative Stephen F. Lynch, a conservative Democrat from South Boston, is expected to announce Thursday that he will challenge Mr. Markey.The rough and tumble of the coming campaign seemed far away at Wednesday’s news conference, which was attended by Mr. Cowan’s wife, Stacey, and their two young sons.“He’s cool,” Lt. Gov. Timothy Murray said of Mr. Cowan. “Tom Brady, George Clooney, James Bond and the president have nothing on Mo.”Mr. Cowan, who usually wears a bow tie but opted not to for this occasion, is a former chief of staff and chief legal counsel to Mr. Patrick, the state’s first black governor.Mr. Cowan said at the news conference that he was proud to take the post, noting that his mother, who was home in North Carolina recovering from knee surgery, was a child of the segregated South and had not attended college.Despite her hardships, he said, “My mother told me that days like this were possible.”He seemed to be a quick study in the senatorial art of not answering questions definitively.Mr. Patrick showed similar deftness, skirting a question about why he had not picked former Representative Barney Frank, who had asserted that he would have loved the interim appointment.Mr. Cowan said that he would be relying on Mr. Kerry’s staff in Washington and in Massachusetts for guidance and that he intended to continue Mr. Kerry’s work.Mr. Patrick, who has served as a mentor to Mr. Cowan, was asked whether he saw some of himself in Mr. Cowan.“I’m not that cool,” the governor replied.",center
"WASHINGTON — All same-sex couples who are legally married will be recognized as such for federal tax purposes, even if the state where they live does not recognize their union, the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service said Thursday.It is the broadest federal rule change to come out of the landmark Supreme Court decision in June that struck down the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, and a sign of how quickly the government is moving to treat gay couples in the same way that it does straight couples.The June decision found that same-sex couples were entitled to federal benefits, but left open the question of how Washington would actually administer them.Their address or the location of their wedding does not matter, as long as the marriage is legal: a same-sex couple who marry in Albany, N.Y., and move to Alabama are treated the same as a same-sex couple who marry and live in Massachusetts.“Today’s ruling provides certainty and clear, coherent tax-filing guidance for all legally married same-sex couples nationwide,” Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said.Gay and civil rights groups praised the ruling.But the Treasury decision could have ramifications for many gay couples’ tax liabilities, said Roberton Williams of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center in Washington.At the same time, same-sex couples will also be able to file amended returns for certain prior tax years, meaning that many couples might be eligible for refunds.But the ruling creates complications for same-sex couples who live in any of the 37 states that do not recognize their marriages.“There’s going to be a cumbersome workaround,” said Nanette Lee Miller of Marcum L.L.P., a public accounting firm.States might also respond to the federal ruling with changes of their own.“We will need to see guidance from each nonrecognition state to see how this will be handled.”The rule change is likely to provide a small increase for federal revenue, as more same-sex couples pay the marriage penalty, Mr. Williams said, describing it as a “rounding error.”The ruling applies to all legal marriages made in the United States or foreign countries.The Treasury ruling is one of many that are starting to emerge from all corners of the federal government as Washington changes regulations to conform with the Supreme Court decision.Separately, the Health and Human Services Department said Thursday that Medicare would extend certain key benefits to same-sex spouses, “clarifying that all beneficiaries in private Medicare plans have access to equal coverage when it comes to care in a nursing home where their spouse lives.”But federal agencies are not moving in lock step.Medicare and Treasury officials have said they would use a “place of celebration” standard for determining whether gay couples are eligible for benefits.But the Social Security Administration is now using a “place of residence” standard in determining spousal benefits, and a gay couple in Alabama might not receive the same benefits as a gay couple in New York until final determinations are made or Congress acts.“It would be nice if they were consistent,” Ms. Miller said.",center
"NRA urges states to allow more armed officers in schoolsThe National Rifle Association called Tuesday for state legislatures to allow more school personnel to carry weapons on school grounds once they've gone through extensive training, as part of a set of recommendations that capped a weeks-long review in the wake of the Newtown mass shooting.The NRA initially took criticism from Democrats for focusing so closely on school security, and rejecting gun control measures, following the Connecticut shooting in which 26 people were killed.Former Arkansas Rep. Asa Hutchinson, who led the NRA's review, appeared to ease off slightly on the call for armed officers in every school -- he said it's ""important"" for every school to have at least one, but acknowledged these decisions are ""locally made"" based on unique budget circumstances.Hutchinson, though, did call for the creation of a 40-60 hour training program for armed officers.""This is not talking about all teachers,"" he said.The 225-page report also called for states to require schools to conduct a safety assessment and for a pilot program to be created assessing mental health as a pre-indicator for violence.Mark Mattioli, the father of one Newtown shooting victim, also spoke after Hutchinson's announcement to applaud the review effort.The review comes as Congress and a number of state legislatures pursue gun control legislation.But LaPierre in December argued that improving school security is paramount.""It's now time for us to assume responsibly for our schools,"" he said.He added: ""The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.""",center
"Facing Congress, Clinton Defends Her Actions Before and After Libya AttackWASHINGTON — In one of her final appearances as secretary of state, Hillary Rodham Clinton on Wednesday vigorously defended her handling of last September’s attack on the United States diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, which killed four Americans and prompted a scathing review of State Department procedures.“As I have said many times, I take responsibility, and nobody is more committed to getting this right,” she said, reading a statement during a day of testimony before Senate and House committees.But Mrs. Clinton, whose appearance before Congress had been postponed since December because of illness, quickly departed from the script.“I stood next to President Obama as the Marines carried those flag-draped caskets off the plane at Andrews,” she said.The continuing controversy over the attack, which resulted in the deaths of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans, has cast a cloud over Mrs. Clinton’s final months at the State Department.In essence, Mrs. Clinton’s approach was to accept the responsibility for security lapses in Benghazi but not the blame.“I feel responsible for the nearly 70,000 people who work for the State Department,” Mrs. Clinton told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in the morning.When the question of her role was taken up again in the afternoon hearing by Representative Ed Royce, the California Republican who is chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Mrs. Clinton acknowledged that she had been briefed on a series of events that indicated that security in Benghazi was deteriorating in the months before the attack.But she said she had gone along with a recommendation from subordinates that the Benghazi post be kept open and assumed that they would take the necessary steps to protect it.Mrs. Clinton first publicly took responsibility for the Sept. 11 attack in an Oct. 15 interview with television reporters.For all of the hours of testimony, the hearings did little to clarify the role of the White House in overseeing the American presence in Libya before the attack or explain why the Pentagon had few forces available on the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks to respond quickly to any assault on diplomatic outposts in the region.One of the sharpest exchanges of the day came when Mrs. Clinton responded to questions from Senator Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, by saying there was too much focus on how the Benghazi attack had been characterized in its early hours and not enough on how to prevent a recurrence.“Was it because of a protest, or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided they’d go kill some Americans?Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, began his questions by saying, “It’s wonderful to see you in good health and as combative as ever,” and then proceeded to complain that she had failed to answer lingering questions.Mr. McCain asserted that the Obama administration’s aversion to nation-building had precluded it from providing the kind of training and assistance that would have helped the fledgling Libyan government in Tripoli confront growing security threats from militants.“We did not give them the kind of assistance that would have been necessary to help dismantle these militias that still, to this day, remain a challenge to democracy in Libya,” he said.Mrs. Clinton responded that Congress had delayed aid to Libya and said she would provide a list of steps that had been taken to train and equip Libyan forces.A persistent line of questioning by Republican lawmakers concerned the initial comments from Ms. Rice that the attack might have resulted from a protest, over an anti-Islamic video, that spun out of control.Mrs. Clinton defended Ms. Rice even as she appeared to distance herself from Ms. Rice’s comments.The Senate Foreign Relations Committee’s chairman, Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, has been nominated to succeed Mrs. Clinton and is scheduled to appear before his committee on Thursday for a confirmation hearing.In a rare criticism of the committee by one of its members, Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, the ranking Republican, complained that the panel Mr. Kerry led had failed to conduct proper oversight of security and other State Department issues.“This is an opportunity for this committee to finally do the work that it should have been doing for years,” Mr. Corker said.Mrs. Clinton sought to put the events in Benghazi in a regional context, noting the presence of a group in northern Mali affiliated with Al Qaeda.“Benghazi didn’t happen in a vacuum,” she said.“We are in for a struggle, but it is a necessary struggle,” she said.",center
"WASHINGTON -- The classified version of a State Department review of last year's assault on an American compound in Benghazi, Libya, found that it was impossible to say what exactly motivated the attackers, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton revealed Wednesday.Speaking at a pair of hearings on Capitol Hill to examine the Obama administration's handling of and response to the attacks, Clinton repeatedly cited the classified version of the review by a State Department Accountability Review Board, distributed to lawmakers last month.""As the ARB makes clear, after their months of research the picture remains still somewhat complicated,"" Clinton said, during an exchange with Sen. James Risch (R-Idaho) at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.The question of what motivated the Benghazi attacks has often been viewed as a duality: Either it was the result of a mob angry over a recently released anti-Islamic video, or it was a terrorist attack.That the administration wavered over its public declarations of the cause of the assault -- repeatedly citing the video before eventually confirming that it was clearly an act of terrorism -- was widely interpreted among critics as evidence of a desire to suppress or conceal the truth.But from the start, the evidence on the scene in Benghazi was more complex.Reporters from The New York Times and Reuters who were on the ground immediately after the attacks relayed that people involved in the mob scene around the compound repeatedly cited the video as a cause of their anger.The Times later stood by that version of events, citing it in its fact-check of Republican attacks on Obama during the presidential campaign.The ARB, in its unclassified form, mentions that the attackers' motivation is the subject of an ongoing FBI investigation.In citing the classified report to rebuff congressional queries about the administration's handling of the crisis, Clinton was drawing on a powerful tool of her office, although discussing a classified document is sure to raise further questions.The added complexity wasn't always satisfying to the legislators who grilled her Wednesday.While being questioned at the House Foreign Relations Committee by Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.), Clinton urged that he read the classified ARB report to find his answers.""There are key questions surrounding the identity, actions and motivations of the perpetrators that remain to be determined,"" she said.To which Duncan replied: ""It was a terrorist attack.",center
"Report Sees Guns as Path to Safety in SchoolsWASHINGTON — With the Senate set to debate gun control this month, a National Rifle Association task force released a 225-page report on Tuesday that called for armed police officers, security guards or staff members in every American school, and urged states to loosen gun restrictions to allow trained teachers and administrators to carry weapons.Asa Hutchinson, a former Republican congressman from Arkansas who led the task force, unveiled the report at a packed news conference with unusually heavy security, including a bomb-sniffing yellow Labrador retriever.Among the study’s central conclusions is that “the presence of armed security personnel adds a layer of security and diminishes response time” in a shooting, Mr. Hutchinson said.The recommendations — which also included expanding the police presence in schools — drew immediate criticism from gun control advocates and many Democrats, who have been fighting to tighten gun restrictions after the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in December.“Arming the teacher is merely a response to the last tragedy,” said Representative Mike Thompson, a California Democrat who is chairman of a House task force on gun violence.After the Newtown shooting, Wayne LaPierre, the rifle association’s executive director, announced that it would devise a plan to put armed guards in every school.Marian Wright Edelman, president of the Children’s Defense Fund, an advocacy group here, criticized the study as “nothing more than a continuation of the N.R.A.’s attempts to prey on America’s fears, saturate our schools with more guns and turn them into armed fortresses.”But the report did get support from at least one Newtown parent: Mark Mattioli, whose 6-year-old son, James, was killed.“I think politics needs to be set aside here, and I hope this doesn’t lead to name-calling,” said Mr. Mattioli, who joined Mr. Hutchinson at the news conference.At least one state, Indiana, is considering the idea of armed officers at schools.The task force panel called on the Departments of Homeland Security, Education and Justice to coordinate school safety efforts and provide grant money for schools to assess their ability to prevent and respond to attacks.The group also called on states to require schools to develop security plans.But how and whether the task force recommendations will be put into effect — and the cost — was unclear.The timing of Tuesday’s announcement was not a coincidence: Congress will wrap up its spring recess after this week and is expected to consider gun legislation after lawmakers return.A plan to revive and revamp a ban on assault weapons, which expired in 2004, is almost certain to be defeated.",center
"WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Department of the Treasury announced Thursday that when it comes to taxes, it will recognize same-sex couples' marriages even if they live in a state that does not.The decision, which was prompted by the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act, marks the latest political progress for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.Prior to this spring, the Internal Revenue Service did not recognize same-sex married couples pursuant to section 3 of DOMA.Thursday’s ruling by Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew provides a uniform policy for the IRS; the state of celebration -- where the wedding took place -- now trumps the state of residency when it comes to federal tax status for same-sex married couples.“Today’s ruling provides certainty and clear, coherent tax filing guidance for all legally married same-sex couples nationwide.The new policy, which was first shared by Lew in a conference call that included LGBT advocates, holds a bit of political significance.Edie Windsor, the plaintiff in the DOMA case, sued the government after being forced to pay estate taxes following the death of her wife, Thea Spyer.Under the new Treasury policy, all federal tax provisions where marriage is a factor, including filing status, employee benefits, IRA contributions, earned income, child tax credits, and income, gift and estate taxes, will apply to same sex couples regardless of where they live.The policy only applies to married couples, and not those in domestic partnerships or same-sex unions.“With today’s ruling, committed and loving gay and lesbian married couples will now be treated equally under our nation’s federal tax laws, regardless of what state they call home,” said Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin.The Treasury’s actions on Thursday are just the latest in a set of LGBT policies offered by agencies within the Obama administration following the DOMA ruling.UPDATE: Commenting on the Treasury Department's new policy, Edie Windsor hailed the decision as the precise remedy that she sought when she challenged the constitutionality of DOMA.",center
"Mo Cowan Senate: Deval Patrick Names Former Chief Of Staff To Replace John KerryWASHINGTON -- Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick (D) on Wednesday appointed William ""Mo"" Cowan to the Senate seat vacated by newly confirmed Secretary of State John Kerry.Patrick, Cowan and Lt. Governor Tim Murray were all smiles as they walked into a news conference to announce the appointment.""He's cool,"" Murray said of Cowan.""It was a private fact, but now known publicly thanks to the lieutenant governor, that he also brought cool,"" Patrick said to laughs.Cowan, 43, is a former chief of staff and former legal counsel to Patrick.Cowan's appointment means that there will be two black senators serving together for the first time in American history.Cowan's selection is a step forward for a state that has a troubled history with race relations, exploding in the South Boston busing riots in the 1970s.Patrick on Wednesday was asked to reflect on the fact that eight years ago, the highest black official in the state was Suffolk County D.A. Ralph Martin.Cowan said Patrick offered him the job on Tuesday, and he accepted.He said there would be ""no daylight"" between him and Kerry on policy.Patrick has consistently said that the pick to succeed Kerry should not run in the general election slated for June 25.The late Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) requested in a letter written before his death that the interim pick to replace him not run in the general election, a principle that Patrick honored after Kennedy died by picking Kennedy's longtime chief of staff, Paul Kirk.Former Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) was the only person to publicly campaign for the interim appointment, announcing his desire to fill the seat on MSNBC and doing subsequent interviews about it.Frank praised Cowan in a brief statement Wednesday.The only announced candidate for the general election is Markey, who has received a flood of endorsements from Democrats -- including Kerry -- and has a $3.1 million war chest.Former Sen. Scott Brown (R-Mass.) has not said what he will do, but the Associated Press reported Tuesday that he was ""leaning strongly"" towards a run and would likely announce his candidacy early next week.",center
"WASHINGTON –- The White House on Wednesday released the full set of emails surrounding the Obama administration’s development of talking points describing the Sept. 11, 2012, attack on the U.S. outpost in Benghazi, Libya, in response to continuing charges from congressional Republicans that there was a massive political “cover-up” of what transpired there.In a briefing with reporters at the White House on Wednesday afternoon, senior administration officials used the 100 pages of emails to show that a number of government agencies, not just the State Department, drove many of the changes to the talking points that were ultimately used by U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice.The cache of emails paint a fuller picture than did an email leaked earlier this week, which portrayed a State Department concerned about its public image.Republican lawmakers have argued that the State Department and the White House were attempting to alter the talking points for political reasons and ignored suggestions and language put forward by the CIA.Critics have said the role of State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland in revising the talking points in particular shows an administration trying to protect its reputation as being tough on terrorism.Nuland said in a Sept. 14 email that she didn't want that information included because it ""could be abused by members [of Congress] to beat up the State Department for not paying attention to warnings, so why would we want to feed that either? Concerned ...""But senior administration officials on Wednesday said that Michael J. Morell, then the deputy director of the CIA, also wanted that line removed, separately from Nuland.Separate from Wednesday's document release, the CIA recently conducted an internal review of how and why the talking points were changed -- a move that also came in response to the continuing questions from Congress.Senior administration officials, discussing that internal review, relayed that some CIA officials didn't like that the original draft of the talking points said the government ""know[s] that Islamic extremists with ties to al-Qa'ida participated in the attack,"" because at that time it was premature to name those responsible for the attacks.Their concerns at other times were more mundane.CIA officers also removed the reference to al Qaeda in order to avoid prejudging the outcome of a FBI investigation into the incident.The timing of the White House's document release raises its own set of questions.While the document dump does soften some of the more critical theories that have arisen with respect to the White House's handling of the events in Benghazi, it could also embolden critics who now see an administration willing to accommodate demands for documents.In a response shortly after the emails were made public on Wednesday, Brendan Buck, spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), said just that.""The House interim report found that 'senior State Department officials requested the talking points be changed to avoid criticism for ignoring the threat environment in Benghazi' and that those changes were ultimately made,"" said Buck.UPDATE: 9 p.m. -- White House spokesman Eric Schultz said he hoped Wednesday's disclosure would put to rest the Benghazi issue.“Despite the fact that e-mails relating to the Benghazi talking points were made available to members of Congress several months ago, in recent days these e-mails have been selectively and inaccurately read out to the media.",right
"Mary Cheney, the younger sister of Wyoming U.S Senate candidate Liz Cheney (R) and daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, criticized her sister's opposition to same-sex marriage in a Friday Facebook post, the New York Times reports.According to the Times, Mary Cheney, who is openly gay and married her partner, Heather Poe, in Washington, DC last year, took to Facebook to rebuke her sister's remarks.“For the record, I love my sister, but she is dead wrong on the issue of marriage,"" she wrote.""Freedom means freedom for everyone,"" she continued.On Friday, Liz Cheney issued a statement voicing her opposition to same-sex marriage.""I am strongly pro-life and I am not pro-gay marriage,"" she said.The elder Cheney daughter is challenging Sen.

"Obama Gun Control Proposals Unveiled, Marking Biggest Legislative Effort In A GenerationWASHINGTON -- In a bold and potentially historic attempt to stem the increase in mass gun violence, President Barack Obama unveiled on Wednesday the most sweeping effort at gun control policy reform in a generation.""This is our first task as a society: keeping our children safe.The proposal, which comes at the end of a month-long review process spearheaded by Vice President Joe Biden, is broken down into four key subsections: law enforcement, the availability of dangerous firearms and ammunition, school safety and mental health.In an effort to touch on all four of those elements, the president recommended requiring criminal background checks for all gun sales; reinstating the assault weapons ban; restoring a 10-round limit on ammunition magazines; eliminating armor-piercing bullets; providing mental health services in schools; allocating funds to hire more police officers; and instituting a federal gun trafficking statute, among other policies.Because these recommendations require congressional approval, the administration is supplementing its proposal with 23 executive actions that will be taken immediately.""I intend to use whatever weight this office holds to make them a reality,"" said the president, speaking about his full set of recommendations.The approach is so sweeping that what would have otherwise been a headline-grabbing announcement received second billing.In total, the proposal goes beyond what most gun control advocates were hoping for at the start of Biden's review process, during which he held 22 different meetings with 229 different organizations and 31 elected officials.""This is a monumental moment.But putting together ideas is the easy part.Seasoned political observers have questioned whether it makes more sense to break the package into separate bills or push for one comprehensive proposal.""I will put everything I've got into this and so will Joe [Biden].""It can't just be the usual suspects,"" he continued.The gun-rights lobby has already signaled that it will try to block the administration's effort.""It is unfortunate that this administration continues to insist on pushing failed solutions to our nation's most pressing problems,"" the NRA said after meeting with Biden last week.The group continued its offensive this week, launching an advertising campaign attacking Obama as an ""elitist hypocrite"" for opposing the NRA's widely-criticized proposal, made after the Newtown, Conn. shooting, to place armed guards in all of the nation's schools.But that attack appeared a bit premature.The White House proposals, even officials there admit, are not a cure-all for mass shootings.Moreover, the administration is pointedly not going after those weapons and ammunition magazines that are currently and lawfully owned.""We are not going to go after existing stock of weapons or magazines,"" said a senior administration official.The White House nevertheless insists that its package of proposals has teeth.The question, in some respects, is not what's missing from the set of ideas, but what took the administration so long to get to this point.""It is not as though we had this whole policy paper sitting on the shelf somewhere,"" said a senior administration official.",center
"WASHINGTON — Jesse L. Jackson Jr., the former Democratic representative from Illinois, pleaded guilty on Wednesday to one felony fraud count in connection with his use of $750,000 in campaign money to pay for living expenses and buy items like stuffed animals, elk heads and fur capes.As part of a plea agreement, prosecutors recommended that Mr. Jackson receive a sentence of 46 to 57 months in prison.“For years I lived off my campaign,” Mr. Jackson, 47, said in response to questions from the judge about the plea.At one point during the hearing, the judge stopped his questioning of Mr. Jackson, who was crying, so that he could be given a tissue.“Guilty, Your Honor — I misled the American people,” Mr. Jackson said when asked whether he would accept the plea deal.Mr. Jackson’s wife, Sandi, also accompanied him, and later in the day she pleaded guilty to a charge that she filed false income tax statements during the time that Mr. Jackson was dipping into his campaign treasury.Mr. Jackson’s plea was yet another chapter in the downward spiral of his career.But as the federal authorities investigated Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich of Illinois over his efforts to sell the Senate seat that President Obama vacated in 2008, they uncovered evidence that one of Mr. Jackson’s friends had offered to make a contribution to Mr. Blagojevich’s campaign in exchange for the seat.Last summer, Mr. Jackson took a medical leave from Congress and was later treated for bipolar disorder.After the hearing, Mr. Jackson’s lawyer, Reid H. Weingarten, said his client had “come to terms with his misconduct.”Mr. Weingarten said that Mr. Jackson had serious health issues that “directly related” to his conduct.“That’s not an excuse, it’s just a fact,” Mr. Weingarten said.Court papers released by federal prosecutors on Wednesday provided new details about how Mr. Jackson and his wife used the $750,000 in campaign money to finance their lavish lifestyle.From 2007 to 2011, Mr. Jackson bought $10,977.74 worth of televisions, DVD players and DVDs at Best Buy, according to the documents.On at least two instances, Mr. Jackson and his wife used campaign money at Build-A-Bear Workshop, a store where patrons can create stuffed animals.One of the more exotic items they bought was an elk head from a taxidermist in Montana.A year later, Mr. Jackson’s wife, knowing that the elk head had been bought with campaign money, had it moved from Washington to Chicago, and she asked a Congressional staff member to sell it, the documents say.In August 2012, the staff member sold the elk head for $5,300 to an interior designer and had the money wired to one of Mr. Jackson’s accounts.Documents released on Friday showed how Mr. Jackson used his campaign money to buy items like fur capes, celebrity memorabilia and expensive furniture.Among those items were a $5,000 football signed by American presidents and two hats that once belonged to Michael Jackson, including a $4,600 fedora.",right
"The Obama administration found itself defending -- and beginning to explain -- yet another surveillance effort after leaked documents revealed information about two secret National Security Agency intelligence-gathering programs.On top of a Guardian newspaper report that revealed how authorities were collecting phone records from millions, a Washington Post report detailed another program that scours major Internet companies including Google and Facebook for data.While civil liberties groups cried foul over the program, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper issued a statement late Thursday decrying the leak of the materials.At the same time, he took the rare step of moving to declassify information about the programs as he sought to defend them against criticism.“The article omits key information regarding how a classified intelligence collection program is used to prevent terrorist attacks and the numerous safeguards that protect privacy and civil liberties,"" he said of the Guardian story.Clapper also said the government was ""prohibited from indiscriminately sifting through the telephony metadata acquired under the program.”Several hours earlier, a senior administration official also pushed back, saying the Guardian article and Washington Post article about the Internet mining refers to collection under a law that ""does not allow the targeting of any U.S. citizen or of any person located within the United States.”It was not immediately clear how the official defined “targeting.”“The program is subject to oversight by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, the Executive Branch, and Congress,” the official said.A former NSA official told Fox News the FBI and National Security Agency (NSA) have been tapping into leading U.S. Internet companies to pull audio, video and photographs.According to the official, the program began in 2007 and is in the second phase.The classified program is code-named PRISM, the Washington Post reported, and has not been disclosed publicly before.According to slides from an internal presentation intended for NSA senior analysts and obtained by the Washington Post, the program accounts for nearly one in seven intelligence reports.The companies that participate knowingly in the program are Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, AOL, Skype, YouTube and Apple, the Washington Post reports.A number of the Internet companies issued statements Thursday night saying they only complied when legally bound to do so.""Even when the system works just as advertised, with no American singled out for targeting, the NSA routinely collects a great deal of American content,"" the Washington Post report said.To be immune from lawsuits, companies like Yahoo and AOL are reportedly obliged to accept a directive from the attorney general and national intelligence director to open their service to the FBI's Data Intercept Technology Unit, which acts as a liaison between the companies and the NSA.According to the slides, there has been “continued exponential growth in tasking to Facebook and Skype.""""With a few clicks and an affirmation that the subject is believed to be engaged in terrorism, espionage or nuclear proliferation, an analyst obtains full access to Facebook’s 'extensive search and surveillance capabilities against the variety of online social networking services,'"" the Washington Post reports.Skype can reportedly be monitored for audio when one end of a call is a conventional telephone and also can be monitored for video, chat and file transfers when users connect just by a computer.A spokesperson for Google says the company ""cares deeply"" about the security of users' data.""We disclose user data to government in accordance with the law, and we review all such requests carefully,"" the spokesperson said.""Protecting the privacy of our users and their data is a top priority for Facebook,"" the company's chief security officer Joe Sullivan said in a statement.A Microsoft spokesperson said that the company only provides customer data after receiving a legally binding order or subpoena.""In addition we only ever comply with orders for requests about specific accounts or identifiers,"" the spokesperson said.",right
"WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama on Friday forcefully defended revelations that the National Security Agency is collecting phone records and electronic communications, saying that Congress was fully briefed and the programs are limited in scope.""The programs are secret in the sense that they are classified.""Your duly elected representatives have consistently been informed,"" he said.News outlets revealed this week that vast spying programs began under President George W. Bush and have continued under Obama.In response to a question after his speech, Obama defended the programs as essential to combating terrorist threats.He also argued that some have overstated the impact of the programs.""I welcome this debate and I think it's healthy for our democracy,"" he continued.Obama portrayed the programs as a trade-off between security and civil liberties.He also expressed his displeasure that the domestic spying programs' existence was leaked to the press.The president's full-throated defense of the programs, albeit with the qualification that he welcomes debate, is unlikely to quell the outrage over the revelations.Obama went on to defend those who operated the programs as ""professionals.""",left
"Former Rep.

Jackson's wife spent $5,150 on fur capes and parkas, court documents said.When prosecutors charged the couple last Friday, the ex-congressman said he fully accepts the responsibility for the improper decisions and mistakes he has made.The conspiracy charge against the former congressman carries a maximum statutory penalty of up to five years in prison, a fine of up to $250,000, and other penalties.The charge against Sandra Jackson carries a maximum of three years in prison.In court papers filed against Jackson on Friday, prosecutors said that upon conviction he must forfeit $750,000, plus tens of thousands of dollars' worth of memorabilia items and furs.As the hearing for Jackson got under way Wednesday, newly filed court papers disclosed that the judge had offered to disqualify himself from handling the cases against Jackson and his wife.As a Harvard Law School student, Wilkins said he had supported the presidential campaign of Jackson's father, civil rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson, and that as an attorney in 1999, Wilkins had been a guest on a show hosted by Jackson's father.In the newly filed court papers, prosecutors and lawyers for both Jesse Jackson Jr. and Sandra Jackson said they were willing to proceed with the cases with Wilkins presiding.",center
"The IRS official who refused to testify at a House hearing Wednesday has become a key focus of the congressional investigations into the IRS practice of singling out conservative groups.Now under the protection of her lawyers and the Fifth Amendment, Lois Lerner is facing a maelstrom of controversy.Members of Congress are calling her evasive, and question why she didn't reveal the program sooner -- plus her history at the Federal Elections Commission is coming under scrutiny.Lerner touched off the public controversy when, at an American Bar Association conference earlier this month, she apologized for the IRS' practice of targeting conservative organizations for additional scrutiny.""They used names like Tea Party or patriots ... and they selected cases simply because the application had those names in the title,"" she admitted.She said she hadn't revealed the information sooner, because she was never asked.Rep. Joseph Crowley, D-N.Y., asked her if she could ""comment briefly on the status on the IRS investigation into these political not-for-profits.""She said: ""Well there's a questionnaire that began this discussion and there's also a questionnaire out there that is seeking info from 501 c3,4,5 organizations.""Crowley later called her answer evasive.""The bottom line is you cannot lie to Congress, and you cannot be evasive, you cannot try to mislead Congress,"" he said.In the 1990's, Lerner also served as chief of enforcement at the Federal Elections Commission.Under her direction, the FEC undertook the largest enforcement action in its history -- suing the Christian Coalition for violating campaign laws.James Bopp, the Christian Coalition's lawyer, said he was ""shocked and appalled"" by that.""Both political activity and religious activity are specifically protected by the First Amendment,"" he said.When Bopp learned years later that Lerner had been promoted to an IRS position, he became concerned.""She was in effect being promoted for what she had done at the Federal Election Commission and now was going to be expected ... to replicate that at the IRS and now we know that's exactly what happened,"" he said.Lerner is represented by lawyer William W.

"Obama urges new restrictions on assault weapons, magazines as part of gun control planPresident Obama called Wednesday for a new and tougher assault-weapons ban and a 10-round limit on magazines, as part of a comprehensive plan to curb gun violence that includes 23 steps he took without congressional action.Already facing stiff opposition from gun-rights advocates and Republican lawmakers, the president called on Congress to pass several major changes to the country's current gun laws -- some of which are already being considered like the restrictions on semi-automatic weapons and high-capacity magazines.Obama called as well for legislation to bar the possession and importation of armor-piercing bullets and to require criminal background checks for nearly all gun sales.""If there's even one life that can be saved, then we've got an obligation to try,"" Obama said.The president was joined by four children who wrote to the White House about gun violence following the Connecticut mass shooting in which 20 children were killed.Despite discussions earlier about addressing the pervasive violence in the entertainment and video game industries, the president's plan did not address those issues in depth.The president, immediately after making his remarks, signed nearly two-dozen executive actions -- a step that has stirred objections from lawmakers who have warned Obama not to overstep his bounds.Unilaterally, Obama on Wednesday directed federal agencies to share information with the federal background check system; proposed new rules to let law enforcement run full background checks before returning a seized gun; ordered the Centers for Disease Control to research causes of gun violence; required law enforcement to trace guns from criminal investigations; and took other steps.The most controversial elements of the president's plan, though, continue to be the proposals he wants Congress to pass.The call for universal background checks would extend to gun shows and private sales, with ""limited"" exemptions for ""certain transfers"" among family members and other situations.Plus the president wants to commit $4 billion to hiring more police officers, and to pass new gun trafficking laws to explicitly prohibit straw purchasing.The plan was already earning a mixed response from lawmakers.Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., accused Obama of trying to ""undermine Americans' constitutional right to bear arms"" without doing enough to focus on keeping guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill.""Nothing the president is proposing would have stopped the massacre at Sandy Hook.Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid said ""all options should be on the table.""Texas Gov. Rick Perry, in a written statement, said: ""Guns require a finger to pull the trigger.Gun-rights groups say the effort to impose more gun control measures is misguided, noting in particular that most killings in America are committed with handguns and not the assault weapons the administration intends to target.The National Rifle Association also plans to launch a major ad campaign.The White House plan does address school security, urging Congress to help schools complete emergency plans; proposing an initiative to help schools hire up to 1,000 resource officers and mental health professionals; and proposing new training for teachers to recognize mental health issues among young people.House Speaker John Boehner declined to weigh in on the merits of the president's proposals Wednesday.""House committees of jurisdiction will review these recommendations.",center

"Colorado's top cop defends pot law after challenges from neighboring statesDenver (AP) – Colorado's top law enforcement official promises to vigorously defend the state's historic law legalizing marijuana after Nebraska and Oklahoma asked the U.S. Supreme Court to declare it unconstitutional, saying the drug is freely flowing into neighboring states.The two states filed a lawsuit seeking a court order to prevent Colorado from enforcing the measure known as Amendment 64, which was approved by voters in 2012 and allows recreational marijuana for adults over 21.Colorado Attorney General John Suthers said the lawsuit was without merit.""Because neighboring states have expressed concern about Colorado-grown marijuana coming into their states, we are not entirely surprised by this action,"" he said.The lawsuit says Colorado marijuana flows into neighboring states undermining their efforts to enforce their anti-marijuana laws.""This contraband has been heavily trafficked into our state,"" Nebraska Attorney General Jon Bruning said at a news conference in Lincoln.Colorado has raised more than $60 million in taxes, licenses and fees from medical and recreational marijuana, which has been sold in stores since January.The lawsuit says the sales have strained Nebraska and Oklahoma's finances and legal systems.Bruning, a Republican, blamed U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder for failing to enforce the federal law's ban on drugs in Colorado.In a policy statement last year, the U.S. Justice Department noted it doesn't have the resources to police all violations of federal marijuana law.Law enforcement agencies have long said anecdotally that they are feeling the impacts of Colorado's legal weed, making more marijuana arrests and seizing more of the drug.But there's no way to know exactly how much legal pot is leaving Colorado.The Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area wrote in a recent report that the amount of Colorado pot seized on highways increased from an annual average of 2,763 pounds between 2005 and 2008 to a yearly average of 3,690 pounds from 2009 to 2013.Scotts Bluff County Sheriff Mark Overman, in western Nebraska, said Colorado marijuana is extra potent, making it worth more in his region and giving sellers a greater financial incentive to do business there.""I think this is overdue, and I think other states should jump on board,"" Overman said of the lawsuit.Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper told The Denver Post he spoke with Nebraska and Oklahoma officials about their concerns.""I'm not sure filing a lawsuit is the most constructive way to find a solution to whatever issues they are,"" he said.Legal scholars say it's too early to know how the Supreme Court might handle the case or if it will even accept it.""Right now, these regulations exist in legal no-man's-land,"" said Sam Kamin, a University of Denver law professor.It was unclear if other neighboring states would take similar action.Brian Vicente, a Colorado attorney and legalization advocate who wrote Amendment 64, said the challenge is ""political grandstanding"" without merit.""I think it shows they are on the wrong side of history,"" Vicente said.",left

"PHOENIX — As the Arizona Legislature sent a bill to her desk Monday that would grant business owners the right to invoke religion to refuse service to gays and others, Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican, faced pressure from many corners to veto the measure, which has cast unwanted national attention on Arizona.Elected officials, civic leaders and business groups spoke out publicly against the measure, which passed both houses of the Legislature on Thursday.On Twitter, Arizona’s United States senators, John McCain and Jeff Flake, also Republicans, had nearly identical posts, with both of them saying they hoped Ms. Brewer would veto the bill.Their calls were echoed by three Republican state senators — Adam Driggs, Steve Pierce and Bob Worsley, all members of the party’s conservative camp — who had helped pass the legislation in the first place.The bill’s remaining supporters took to the airwaves and the Internet to defend it.Ms. Brewer was in Washington on Monday but was scheduled to return Tuesday to Phoenix, where she will have until the end of the week to act on the bill.The religion bill comes as Arizona prepares to host the Super Bowl next year and struggles to regain its economic vitality.And Barry Broome, president and chief executive of the Greater Phoenix Economic Council, said that leaders of four companies looking to relocate to Arizona had put his organization on notice, saying they might reconsider if the bill became law.Among the Republicans vying to succeed Ms. Brewer, who cannot run for re-election because of term limits, there was broad consensus against the measure, which would expand the state’s definition of “exercise of religion” to protect businesses and citizens from lawsuits after denying services on religious grounds.One candidate, Scott Smith, the mayor of Mesa, who is a Mormon, said that the bill “gives carte blanche for anybody to discriminate under the guise of religion.”Mr. Wilder, the governor’s spokesman, said Ms. Brewer’s office had received more than 10,000 calls and emails on the matter as of Monday morning.",center
"FERGUSON, Mo. — Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. arrived in St. Louis on Wednesday, meeting with community leaders and federal investigators even as local law enforcement officials said they were hopeful that they had turned a corner in calming the restive community of Ferguson after 12 days of protests and unrest.Mr. Holder’s first stop was at a community college, where he met with people who told him about their own personal experiences with the local police, some of which they said helped fuel the rage that was ultimately ignited by the shooting of an unarmed black teenager by a white police officer on Aug. 9.There were more protests planned throughout the day and into the evening, but Capt. Ronald S. Johnson of the Missouri State Highway Patrol said he believed they had reached “a turning point.”Captain Johnson, whose agency is overseeing security here, said there were only sporadic problems on Tuesday night, and none of the wide-scale looting and confrontations that had erupted on other nights.As the tension on the street seemed to ease, the focus turned to the investigation into the shooting death of Michael Brown.A grand jury has been convened and was scheduled to meet Wednesday to begin hearing evidence, said Edward Magee, a spokesman for Robert P. McCulloch, the prosecuting attorney for St. Louis County.Protesters gathered outside Mr. McCulloch’s office on Wednesday, calling for him to step aside.Mr. McCulloch, speaking to a local radio station, categorically rejected that notion.“I know the pain the Brown family is going through right now,” he said.He said he has only one interest: conducting a fair and thorough investigation.“Anyone who wants me off the case needs to call up the governor and express their opinion to him,” Mr. McCulloch told KTRS radio.By failing to act, Mr. McCulloch said, the governor “undermines everything except the cover he has pulled over his head.”Mr. Magee cautioned that it could take weeks for the grand jury to consider all of the evidence.The Justice Department, meanwhile, has started a separate inquiry.In an open letter to the people of Ferguson, Mr. Holder said he understood the desire of residents for an “independent” inquiry.“This is my pledge to the people of Ferguson: Our investigation into this matter will be full, it will be fair, and it will be independent,” Mr. Holder wrote in The St. Louis Post-Dispatch.The frustrations in the community have been fueled in part by the slow pace with which the authorities have released information.In a sign of just how deep the distrust runs, there were three separate autopsies performed on Mr. Brown’s body: one by the county medical examiner, one by a private pathologist hired by the family, and one by federal authorities.In addition to the many lingering questions about the shooting, the local authorities have also come under criticism for how they have handled the protests.Norm Stamper, the former Seattle police chief who was in charge during the protests that rocked that city in 1999, said that the wrong tone was set from the first day in Ferguson.“The basic perspective that I have over this whole thing, dating back to the shooting incident itself, what we had were largely peaceful vigils and protests that were met with police tactics that were highly aggressive and militaristic,” he said.He reserved his harshest criticism for the use of tear gas by the police — a mistake he said he made in Seattle and one he regrets to this day.Since the first day of protests in Ferguson, the authorities shifted their response almost daily, adding to the sense that the situation was out of control.On one day, protesters were told to gather in one place. Another day, they were told to keep moving.“You get governors and police chiefs and everyone gnashing their teeth,” Mr. Stamper said.On Tuesday night, however, it seemed that some of that energy had gone from the streets.The evening began in a familiar fashion: Demonstrators marched along the street and chanted “Hands up! Don’t shoot!” and other slogans that have become common here since Mr. Brown’s death.The authorities made at least 47 arrests after demonstrators tossed bottles toward police officers, some of whom used pepper spray to subdue some protesters.Although law enforcement officers in riot gear eyed the protesters while a police helicopter occasionally circled the city, there were no signs of trouble for long stretches of the evening.When a demonstration ended shortly before midnight, many of the demonstrators prayed.“Now that’s what I call a good protest,” Jonathan Smith, 45, said.",center
"Representative Michael G. Grimm, a former F.B.I. agent and Marine who capitalized on his straight-arrow image to win a seat in Congress, was expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges after a lengthy corruption investigation, people with knowledge of the case said on Friday.The charges against Mr. Grimm, 44, a Republican who was first elected in 2010 and represents Staten Island and part of Brooklyn, were expected to include mail fraud and wire fraud, and to focus largely on his conduct in connection with a health food restaurant he owned on the Upper East Side of Manhattan after he left the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 2006, two of the people said.The investigation of the second-term congressman, by the F.B.I. and the United States attorney’s office in Brooklyn, began more than two years ago with an examination of Mr. Grimm’s fund-raising for his 2010 race and expanded.But on Friday, it did not appear that the indictment would include any campaign finance charges or accusations that the congressman had misused his office, although several of the people noted that the investigation was continuing.A lawyer for Mr. Grimm, William McGinley of Patton Boggs, confirmed in a statement that prosecutors intended to file criminal charges against his client and said that Mr. Grimm “asserts his innocence” and that the investigation was “a politically driven vendetta.”“After more than two years of investigation plagued by malicious leaks, violations of grand jury secrecy and strong-arm tactics, the U.S. attorney’s office has disclosed its intent to file criminal charges against Congressman Grimm,” Mr. McGinley said.Spokesmen for the office of the United States attorney in Brooklyn, Loretta E. Lynch, and for the New York F.B.I. office declined to comment.Mr. Grimm, the only Republican member of New York City’s congressional delegation, is up for re-election in November and faces a potentially formidable challenger in former City Councilman Domenic M. Recchia Jr., a Democrat who headed the Council’s Finance Committee and was Christine C. Quinn’s chief lieutenant when she was Council speaker.In January 2012, the New York State Workers’ Compensation Board ordered Healthalicious to pay $88,000 for not carrying workers’ compensation insurance.Mr. Grimm over time developed something of a reputation for being hot-tempered, which did not set him apart from many others in Congress.After President Obama’s State of the Union address, NY1’s Washington reporter, Michael Scotto, interviewed the congressman about the speech.",center
"WASHINGTON — A young Republican congressional aide resigned Monday after her Facebook post berating President Obama’s daughters for their attitude and outfits during the annual White House turkey pardon became a sensation on the Internet.On Friday, the aide, Elizabeth Lauten, 31, who has more than 14,000 followers on Twitter as @DCGopGirl and at the time was a spokeswoman for a little-known congressman from Tennessee, wrote an open letter to Sasha and Malia Obama on her Facebook page, saying they should “try showing a little class” and “dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar.”By Monday, Ms. Lauten had resigned as communications director to Representative Stephen Fincher, a farmer and gospel singer perhaps best known for his whimsically named hometown, Frog Jump.It started Wednesday with the most innocuous of events: the annual naming of the National Thanksgiving Turkey, when Mr. Obama officially liberated Cheese, a large white bird with impressive plumage, from the Thursday dinner table.Per tradition, the first daughters were in attendance, this time wearing mostly cheerless expressions and short outfits.At times, the girls gazed glumly at the floor and threw an occasional eye roll at their father as he compared pardoning Cheese to granting amnesty to unauthorized immigrants.“Nah,” Malia said quickly.Their teenage disdain drew its fair share of media attention, including a BuzzFeed article titled “The Obama Girls Could Not Be More Bored by Their Dad’s Jokes.”Enter Ms. Lauten — a former Republican National Committee new media aide who describes herself on Twitter as loving God, cats, the Daughters of the American Revolution “& all things pink, green and pearls!” — whose commentary had a sharper edge.“I get you’re both in those awful teen years, but you’re a part of the First Family, try showing a little class,” she wrote above a picture of the unenthused Obama daughters.She went on to say that Malia and Sasha were “coming up a little short in the ‘good role model’ department” because their parents “don’t respect their positions very much, or the nation for that matter.”Ms. Lauten wrote what she thought the daughters should have done: “Rise to the occasion.Her views were widely circulated and eventually posted on Twitter by a reporter for The Root, a news, opinion and culture site aimed at African-American audiences.Ms. Lauten, who did not respond to repeated requests for further comment, later posted an apology for her “hurtful” words, saying she had “judged the two young ladies in a way that I would never have wanted to be judged myself as a teenager.”Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, told reporters on Monday that he was “taken aback that there was some political operative on Capitol Hill who did use the occasion of a Thanksgiving-themed event to criticize members of the first family.”Patti Davis, the daughter of Ronald Reagan, could relate.“As First Daughters, you can’t win,” Ms. Davis wrote.",center
"WASHINGTON — Representative Raúl R. Labrador, a Republican of Idaho who has barely served two terms in Congress, jumped into the race for House majority leader on Friday, offering himself as the more conservative alternative who could pull the House rightward in the wake of Representative Eric Cantor’s loss in a primary.“The message from Tuesday is clear — Americans are looking for a change in the status quo,” Mr. Labrador, a former immigration lawyer elected in the Tea Party wave of 2010, said in a statement.While some of those conservative lawmakers elected in 2010 were hoping that the House leadership elections on Thursday would offer them the chance to reclaim their influence on Capitol Hill, few of them give Mr. Labrador much of a chance against the current House majority whip, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California.Supporters of Mr. McCarthy, who confidently traveled home to his district in Bakersfield for the weekend, said Friday that the Californian had all but sewed up the votes he needs.“We have got to have an alternative,” Representative Louie Gohmert, Republican of Texas, said on Glenn Beck’s conservative radio show.House conservatives — lacking a rationale to fight Mr. McCarthy, a well-liked member of leadership who has raised millions of dollars for Republican incumbents — have begun protesting that his voting record is actually to the left of Mr. Cantor’s.FreedomWorks, which has provided financial support for Tea Party candidates, immediately began trying to generate support for Mr. Labrador through its websites and email lists.Matt Kibbe, the group’s president and chief executive, said that he did not have great qualms with Mr. McCarthy’s ideology, but that he was more about politics than ideas.But Mr. Labrador’s path to victory is steep, especially in the few days before House Republicans gather to elect Mr. Cantor’s replacement.Conservative Republicans in the House pleaded Friday for a delay in the voting.For his part, Mr. Boehner has remained firm that he wanted to get it done quickly and minimize disruption.Mr. McCarthy spent much of the day calling members and shoring up support, said a Republican aide close to the majority whip.Some lawmakers questioned whether his run was really a quest to win the majority leader’s post or merely to raise his own profile.Tea Party groups off Capitol Hill may believe Mr. Labrador can win, and they will pressure House conservatives to join the campaign.Mr. Labrador tried on Friday to at least engage the Republican conference in a debate over ideas.“I am running for majority leader because I want to help create a vision of growth and opportunity for everyone and start getting to work for the American people,” he said.Representative Justin Amash, Republican of Michigan, rushed to champion Mr. Labrador’s candidacy.“We can’t respond to a stunning loss by giving a pat on the back and promotion to the same team,” Mr. Amash said of Mr. Cantor’s defeat.",center
"WASHINGTON — House Republicans are preparing to unveil their own broad template for overhauling the nation’s immigration system this week, potentially offering a small opening for President Obama and congressional Democrats to pass bipartisan legislation before the end of the year.Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio and other Republican leaders are expected to release a one-page statement of immigration principles this week at their annual retreat in Cambridge, Md., according to aides with knowledge of the plan.The Republican effort comes as Mr. Obama is expected to push once again for an overhaul of the immigration system in his State of the Union address Tuesday, and as lawmakers from both parties describe immigration as one of the few potential areas for bipartisan compromise before the end of the current Congress.“The principles they lay out I’m sure won’t satisfy everybody,” Michael R. Bloomberg, former mayor of New York City, said at an immigration forum on Friday.The Senate, led by Democrats, passed a broad bipartisan measure in June to overhaul immigration that included a 13-year path to citizenship.But heading into the three-day Republican retreat, even some of the most ardent conservatives say consensus is forming around an immigration package that would include several separate bills on border security; a clampdown against the hiring of undocumented workers; expanded guest-worker programs; a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants brought to the country as children; and a path to legal status for undocumented workers with family ties to citizens or employer sponsors.The White House has said it wants a path to citizenship for both children and adults in any new immigration legislation.“The president’s pathway to citizenship is a stumbling block,” said Representative Andy Harris, a conservative Republican who represents the Maryland district that will host the retreat.Representative Peter T. King, a Republican of New York and a longtime critic of proposals to change the immigration system, said it was significant that both the third-ranking Republican in the House, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, and the Judiciary Committee chairman, Representative Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia, had voiced support in recent days for legal status for some immigrants living in the country illegally — and have taken very little heat for their remarks on either side of the aisle.But the divisions that have slowed progress in the House have not been entirely mended.“The president has shown he’s not willing to work with us on immigration,” Mr. Labrador said.On Thursday, aides to House conservatives who oppose the leadership’s plan gathered in the office of Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama and a fierce opponent of the immigration push, to plot a strategy to torpedo it.Critics worry that House Republican leaders and Senate Democrats are essentially negotiating a final deal, bypassing formal House-Senate negotiations, where conservatives had hoped to derail the process.",center
"Federal prosecutors in New Jersey have issued grand jury subpoenas to Gov. Chris Christie’s re-election campaign and to the state Republican Party as part of a preliminary inquiry into accusations that aides to Mr. Christie shut down access lanes to the George Washington Bridge as political retribution, the lawyer for the campaign and the party said Thursday.A person briefed on the matter said the prosecutors had also issued subpoenas to some of the 20 people and entities — including potential witnesses and people who have come under scrutiny in the inquiry — that received subpoenas last week from a New Jersey legislative committee whose investigation largely parallels the federal one.“We can confirm that the Christie for Governor re-election campaign and the New Jersey Republican State Committee received subpoenas for documents from the U.S. attorney’s office, in addition to the subpoena the campaign previously received from the state legislative committee,” the lawyer, Mark D.

Luskin; both men are partners at Patton Boggs.“The campaign and the state party intend to cooperate with the U.S. attorney’s office and the state legislative committee and will respond to the subpoenas accordingly,” Mr. Sheridan said.According to the person briefed on the matter, the subpoenas, issued by prosecutors in the office of the United States attorney for New Jersey, Paul J. Fishman, seek a broad range of records relating to the lane closings: emails, text messages, other correspondence and memorandums, calendar entries, spreadsheets, voice mail messages.They also specifically seek records relating to three close aides to Mr. Christie who resigned or were fired when their roles in the lane closings were revealed.Federal Bureau of Investigation agents and prosecutors from Mr. Fishman’s office have also undertaken what appears to be an unrelated inquiry.The lieutenant governor, Kim Guadagno, emphatically denied the allegations on Monday.The bridge inquiry being conducted by Mr. Fishman’s office was confirmed this month.A spokeswoman for Mr. Fishman’s office, Rebekah Carmichael, said Thursday afternoon that she could neither confirm nor deny whether any specific investigative steps had been taken.Despite the inquiries, Mr. Christie seemed to be trying to conduct business as usual.",center
"One of the highest-profile Republicans in the House of Representatives – where national immigration reform will live or die this year – said he agrees with giving undocumented immigrants a chance to legalize their status.Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy, who is the third-ranking Republican in the House, made his comments in an interview with KBFX-TV in Bakersfield, Calif. just as his fellow GOP lawmakers are expected to unveil any day a set of “immigration principles” that reportedly call for a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants.“The principles aren’t written yet, but in my personal belief, I think it’ll go with legal status that will allow you to work and pay taxes,” he said.McCarthy’s district is roughly 35 percent Latino.The House Republican immigration principles reportedly will cover how the U.S. border should be protected, how immigration laws should be enforced inside the United States, and how many of the country’s estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants can embark on a path to legalize their status, according to various media stories.The path to legalization’s inclusion in the plan – which House Republican leaders discussed as recently as Wednesday -- is particularly significant given that it is one of the pivotal reasons that plans last year to pass a comprehensive immigration reform law broke down in the House of Representatives after it passed in the Senate in June.Conservative members of the Republicans in the House, where they hold a majority, had been adamant about not signing off on any measure that called for granting a pathway to legalization for people who are living in the country illegally.That created a fight among Republicans in Congress, with some – including conservatives such as Sen. Marco Rubio, a Tea Party lawmaker from Florida – arguing that deporting all 11 million undocumented immigrants was not a realistic option, and that not doing anything to bring them onto the radar amounted to an amnesty.Proponents of a pathway to legal status argued that the opportunity would be given only to those undocumented immigrants who earned it by meeting a strict set of criteria including paying fines, learning English, having a clean police record and paying taxes.Politico, a news site that covers politics, reported that House Speaker John Boehner, who is from Ohio, wants the plan, also referred to as “principles,” completed and made public before President Barack Obama delivers his State of the Union address on Jan. 28.The plan commits itself to the idea – which is heavily favored by many Republicans – that immigration reform will be handled in a piecemeal fashion, instead of comprehensively, as the Senate did.Obama told Senate Democrats this week that he believes that Boehner will make sure immigration reform is passed this year, according to The Hill, a a political publication in Washington, D.C.The president reportedly told the Democrats in a meeting that Republicans need to take action on immigration in order to keep the volatile issue from hurting their chances with Latino voters, as it appears to have done in 2012, when GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney did extremely poorly with the increasingly important voting bloc.Obama obtained three quarters of Latino votes cast in 2012, while Romney racked up 27 percent.Sen.

"A two-term Republican congressman from Idaho with a track record of challenging the House Republican leadership said Friday he would run for the No. 2 job in the chamber.Raul Labrador, a 46-year-old Mormon father of five, tea party congressman and Puerto Rican-born only child of a single mother, will challenge House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) for the position of House majority leader.It's a long shot bid.In his current role as whip, McCarthy's job is to round up votes from other Republicans.The former immigration attorney stepped forward to run after a number of other conservative House Republicans declined to.“I was stunned when Eric Cantor lost his primary election earlier this week.He also said that he would run for majority leader in hopes of creating ""a leadership team that can bring the Republican conference together.""Since the 2010 midterm tea party wave election, the House GOP has contained a bloc of members who have opposed the establishment leadership time and time again.When Cantor lost his seat in a shock result Tuesday, conservatives in the House were not prepared to unite behind a standard-bearer, much less wage an organized effort to whip up votes in support of a candidate for majority leader.On Friday, the Washington Post reported that Hensarling does not plan to run, according to three people familiar with his plans.Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas) was the other conservative alternate to McCarthy, though he is almost as much an establishment character as anyone else in leadership.The situation left House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and the rest of the Republican leadership in the House with a problem: The 40 or so hardline tea party members of the House GOP do not want the response to Cantor's loss -- which was driven by grassroots discontent with the establishment -- to simply be more establishment leadership.Members of the tea party caucus also want to vote for a majority leader candidate that they believe in, even if he loses.There is always a chance that grassroots fervor in support of Labrador could gain a level of intensity that Boehner and McCarthy did not anticipate.Labrador is an ambitious, sometimes savvy politician.“There really is a question what is the message that’s sent when the voters replace someone in leadership.",right

"In one of the highest-profile showdowns between establishment Republicans and Tea Party conservatives so far this year, Rep. Raul Labrador said Friday that he is challenging Rep. Kevin McCarthy for the House majority leader position that became open this week.Labrador, of Idaho, would be the Tea Party alternative to McCarthy, who is the whip and is favored by establishment Republicans.Labrador’s foray into the race for majority leader is yet another dramatic turn of events for Republicans, who were stunned by the defeat in Tuesday’s primary in Virginia of Rep. Eric Cantor to a Tea Party candidate who cast the congressman as someone who embraces the status quo of Beltway GOP politics and did not truly represent his constituents.Americans don’t believe their leaders in Washington are listening and now is the time to change that.And it upends the June 19 voting by the House Republicans for majority leader.“I was stunned when Eric Cantor lost his primary election earlier this week,” Labrador, who is 46, said in his announcement about running for majority leader.Some conservatives in the House were pushing for a postponement of the June 19 election for majority leader, saying they wanted more time to put someone with more right-wing views in the running for the position.“I want a…leadership team that can bring the Republican conference together,” Labrador said in his statement, “A leadership team that can help unite and grow our party.Some lawmakers pressed Labrador to run, according to several published reports that quoted unnamed sources.Economics professor Dave Brat, the Tea Party candidate who defeated Cantor, attacked the congressman as soft on border security and on people who come here illegally.Cantor, who had once been more moderate on immigration issues – particularly on the bitterly divisive aspect of whether to give undocumented immigrants already in the U.S. a chance to legalize their status – shifted sharply to a hard line position, saying he would block any effort in the House to consider proposals to give such immigrants a break.But some observers said Cantor’s tough stance toward the end of the primary – one he’d seemed confident he’d easily win – was too little too late.Others say it was Cantor’s lack of popularity in general in his district, and his lackluster campaign, that doomed him.Nonetheless, many see the next majority leader as potentially influencing the House handling of immigration reform, which stalled as conservative members said they would not support a comprehensive measure for an overhaul of the system, and especially not one that, in their view, would grant amnesty to lawbreakers.The Senate last year passed a sweeping bipartisan immigration reform bill that both tightened border security and provided a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants who meet a strict set of criteria.McCarthy, whose district is 35 percent Latino, has expressed support for providing a path to legal status, but only after those applying for it earn it by learning English and paying fines and taxes, among other things.Labrador, who worked as an immigration attorney before serving in Congress, was part of a bipartisan group in the House that was working on a reform bill.Labrador has not been shy about criticizing House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio, saying that he should step down if he allows a vote on an immigration bill this year.He has said he will not back a version of the Senate reform bill, and prefers to deal with the subject in a piecemeal fashion.Labrador says this about himself on his website: “Born to a single mother in Puerto Rico, Raúl Labrador moved with his mother to the mainland U.S. at age 13.”“His mother worked many different jobs to make ends meet,” it says.One of the conservative members in the House who wanted to postpone the June 19 vote for majority leader quickly indicated that for him, Labrador would not do.Rep.

"DENVER — Two heartland states filed the first major court challenge to marijuana legalization on Thursday, saying that Colorado’s growing array of state-regulated recreational marijuana shops was piping marijuana into neighboring states and should be shut down.The lawsuit was brought by attorneys general in Nebraska and Oklahoma, and asks the United States Supreme Court to strike down key parts of a 2012 voter-approved measure that legalized marijuana in Colorado for adult use and created a new system of stores, taxes and regulations surrounding retail marijuana.While marijuana remains illegal under federal law, officials have largely allowed Colorado and other states to move ahead with state-run programs allowing medical and recreational marijuana.“Marijuana flows from this gap into neighboring states,” the suit says, undermining their marijuana bans, “draining their treasuries, and placing stress on their criminal justice systems.”For months, some sheriffs and police officers in rural counties bordering Colorado have complained that they have seen more marijuana entering their towns and being transported down their highways since recreational sales began in January.“We’re seeing a lot of marijuana coming over from Colorado,” said Sheriff Adam Hayward of Deuel County, Neb., who said that he was gratified that the two states were challenging Colorado’s marijuana laws.Colorado’s attorney general, John Suthers, a Republican, said in a statement that the challenge from Nebraska and Oklahoma was “without merit.”Nebraska and Oklahoma’s challenge is aimed more at the commercial side of marijuana legalization, which created new systems of regulations and taxes as well as recreational stores, dispensaries and production facilities that are monitored and licensed by state officials.But marijuana advocates said that the challenge — if it succeeds at shutting down marijuana retailers — could boost the black market.“If Nebraska and Oklahoma succeed, they will put the violent criminal organizations back in charge,” Michael Elliott, the executive director of the Marijuana Industry Group, a Colorado-based trade group, said in a statement.The lawsuit, which was brought by Nebraska’s attorney general, Jon Bruning, and Oklahoma’s attorney general, Scott Pruitt, accused Colorado officials of participating in a “scheme” that cultivates, packages and distributes marijuana in direct violation of controlled-substances laws while “ignoring every objective embodied in the federal drug control regulation.”“The Constitution and the federal antidrug laws do not permit the development of a patchwork of state and local pro-drug policies and licensed distribution schemes throughout the country,” the lawsuit says.Nebraska and Oklahoma accused Colorado of leaving huge holes in marijuana rules that allowed the plant to flow out of state.While it is against the law to take legally purchased marijuana across state lines, Nebraska and Oklahoma said that Colorado does not require consumers to smoke or eat their marijuana where they buy it, and said that despite purchasing and possession limits, anyone can easily visit several dispensaries and stock up.They also criticized Colorado for not tracking marijuana once it is sold, and for not requiring marijuana buyers to undergo criminal background checks (under Colorado law, anyone 21 or older can legally purchase recreational marijuana).Nebraska and Oklahoma complained about a “significant influx of Colorado-sourced marijuana,” but the suit did not mention specific statistics about Colorado-related marijuana arrests or drug seizures.",left
"WASHINGTON — In one of the most stunning primary election upsets in congressional history, the House majority leader, Eric Cantor, was soundly defeated on Tuesday by a Tea Party-backed economics professor who had hammered him for being insufficiently conservative.The result delivered a major jolt to the Republican Party — Mr. Cantor had widely been considered the top candidate to succeed Speaker John A. Boehner — and it has the potential to change both the debate in Washington on immigration and, possibly, the midterm elections.With just over $200,000, David Brat, a professor at Randolph-Macon College in Ashland, Va., toppled Mr. Cantor, repeatedly criticizing him for being soft on immigration and contending that he supported what critics call amnesty for immigrants in the country illegally.During a short concession speech late Tuesday, Mr. Cantor did not try to analyze his defeat or cast blame, saying only that he knew he had disappointed his supporters.In victory, Mr. Brat said that his candidacy had resonated with voters who believed that politics had been dumbed down by partisan infighting.“The American people want to pay attention to serious ideas again,” Mr. Brat said, speaking on Fox News.Republicans were so sure that Mr. Cantor would win that most party leaders had been watching for how broad his victory would be.Mr. Cantor, 51, who is in his seventh term, had sought to counter Mr. Brat’s accusations that he was too willing to compromise on immigration.But with significant help from conservative talk radio hosts like Laura Ingraham, Mr. Brat was able to galvanize opposition to Mr. Cantor in one of Virginia’s most conservative congressional districts.Ms. Ingraham, one of the few high-profile conservatives to put her muscle behind Mr. Brat, said on Fox News on Tuesday night that the primary results were “an absolute repudiation of establishment politics” and that Republican leaders should take note.“He really just didn’t have very much money, but what he did have was a lot of heart,” she said of Mr. Brat.Mr. Cantor’s loss recalled the defeat of former Speaker Thomas S. Foley, a Democrat who lost to a little-known Republican, George Nethercutt, in the 1994 general elections that delivered control of Congress to the Republicans.Mr. Brat had little help from national groups that have funded other Tea Party challengers.Larry Nordvig, executive director of the Richmond Tea Party, said the national groups were not aware of “how much activity was going on underneath the surface down here and how large the ABC — Anybody But Cantor — mentality was.”In a February interview, Mr. Brat spoke of the difficulty he had in rounding up conservative support despite meeting with powerful groups and donors to try to convince them that he was worth the investment.Mr. Cantor had won primaries in his district, which stretches from Richmond to the Washington suburbs, with as much as 79 percent of the vote, and he won the general election race for a seventh term in 2012 with 58 percent.Within the Republican Party, he was seen as a star, with the ability to tap into the energy of the House’s more conservative members while at the same time not alienating the party’s establishment wing.In the House, his relationship with Mr. Boehner reflected some of the larger tensions within the party.Mr. Boehner said Tuesday that he and Mr. Cantor had “been through a lot together,” making “tough choices that come with governing.”Mr. Cantor received what amounted to a warning shot from local Republicans at a district convention last month in Henrico County, his political home base, when conservatives ousted one of his loyalists as Republican chairman while he looked on.Yet he seemed to recognize the seriousness of the threat only in the final weeks of the campaign, when he suddenly shifted his advertising and began sending aides from Washington to his district.“There are some very angry people upset with the status quo, and Eric became part of that,” said former Representative Thomas M. Davis III, a Virginia Republican.As for the prospects of an immigration overhaul now, Mr. Davis said: “How do you get that or anything done now? Eric is too liberal? This was the guy holding Boehner back.”Many voters also perceived Mr. Cantor as ignoring district concerns as he sought to raise his national profile.It was all part of his ambition to become speaker of the House, having begun his career as the driver to his predecessor, Representative Thomas J. Bliley Jr.“I’m in shock,” said Representative Patrick T. McHenry, Republican of North Carolina.Congressional Democrats were ecstatic, and so stunned by Mr. Cantor’s loss that many admitted they did not even know who the Democratic challenger was.An informal dinner party at the Georgetown apartment of Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, turned into a celebration.“I never thought I’d see the day that Eric Cantor would be losing his primary,” said Representative Louise M. Slaughter of New York, the senior Democrat on the House Rules Committee.Ms. Pelosi said, “I still can’t even believe it.”",center
"Prominent Republicans are calling for Ariz. Gov. Jan Brewer to veto a controversial bill that would allow businesses to deny service over religious beliefs.The Republican governor returned home Tuesday afternoon to a political climate that is much different from just a week ago when she left for Washington the last five days for a governor's conference.The Arizona Legislature passed a bill last week allowing businesses whose owners cite sincerely held religious beliefs to deny service to gays.The legislation has caused a national uproar.Brewer will likely spend the next day or more pondering Senate Bill 1062 before deciding whether to sign or veto the legislation.There is widespread speculation that Brewer will veto the bill, but she has not said how she'll act, as is her longtime practice with pending legislation.Political observers in Arizona cautioned that the governor is deliberate and not prone to act hastily, despite the growing calls from business, politicians of all stripes, and civil rights groups for a veto.""She's no rookie to these high-profile deals — she gives both sides their due,"" said Doug Cole, a political consultant whose firm has run all of Brewer's campaigns for decades.""She's going to get a very detailed briefing from her legal team, and give the proponents their best shot, and the opponents their best shot,"" he said.Some Republican senators who pushed the bill through the Legislature are now calling for a veto as well, but they cite ""inaccurate"" information about the measure for igniting a firestorm.Democrats say that argument doesn't wash and call SB1062 ""toxic"" legislation that allows discrimination.""We brought this to their attention five weeks ago,"" said Sen.

"Nebraska, Oklahoma File Federal Suit Against Colorado Over Marijuana LegalizationThe states of Nebraska and Oklahoma filed a federal lawsuit in the U.S. Supreme Court Thursday, claiming that Colorado's legalization of recreational marijuana is unconstitutional under federal law.""Federal law undisputedly prohibits the production and sale of marijuana,"" Nebraska Attorney General Jon Bruning said Thursday in a statement.But Colorado Attorney General John Suthers isn't backing down.“Because neighboring states have expressed concern about Colorado-grown marijuana coming into their states, we are not entirely surprised by this action,"" Suthers said.Bruning, along with Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, argue that under the U.S. Constitution's Supremacy Clause, Colorado's legalization of recreational marijuana is unconstitutional because marijuana remains illegal under federal law.""The illegal products being distributed in Colorado are being trafficked across state lines thereby injuring neighboring states like Oklahoma and Nebraska,"" Pruitt said in a statement.The regulation of recreational marijuana -- as seen in programs currently in place in Colorado and Washington state, as well as those that will soon go into effect in Oregon and Alaska -- remains illegal under the 1970 Controlled Substances Act.Colorado voters approved Amendment 64, legalizing recreational marijuana in the state, in 2012.With a majority of Americans now supporting marijuana legalization, and with states continuing to pass legalization laws, it seems unlikely that the federal government would push back against the legalizations.Harvard economist Jeff Miron, a vocal supporter of marijuana policy reform, highlighted the precarious nature of state marijuana laws in a November op-ed for CNN, saying that Congress needs to act now on federal marijuana policy.""Despite the compelling case for legalization, and progress toward legalization at the state level, ultimate success is not assured,"" Miron wrote.Kevin Sabet, president of anti-legalization group Smart Approaches to Marijuana, applauded the action by Nebraska and Oklahoma.""We support this action by the attorneys general of Oklahoma and Nebraska because Colorado's decisions regarding marijuana are not without consequences to neighboring states, and indeed all Americans,"" Sabet said.Mason Tvert, communications director for Marijuana Policy Project, told The Huffington Post that MPP agrees with Suthers' opinion that the suit is ""without merit.""""Nebraska officials are acting like bullies, and they have no business trying to dictate Colorado's marijuana laws,"" Tvert said to HuffPost.Marijuana Industry Group's Mike Elliott echoed Tvert's sentiments, adding that despite the multi-decade federal war on drugs, marijuana remains ""universally available"" -- including in Nebraska and Oklahoma.""If Nebraska and Oklahoma succeed, they will put the violent criminal organizations back in charge,"" Elliott said.Rep.

Kennedy in an assertive call to project American power abroad.In comments delivered at the Council on Foreign Relations, the conservative senator vying for the GOP presidential nomination said the world would be safer if the U.S. military had a bigger budget and America asserted itself more aggressively across the globe.While the threats facing the United States have changed in the 21st century, America's global influence remains a benevolent force, Rubio said.""President Kennedy, like most presidents before and since, understood what I believe our current president does not: that American strength is a means of preventing war, not promoting it,” Rubio said.""Sadly, I believe President Obama often disagrees with that simple truth,"" Rubio added.In laying out what his campaign calls the ""Rubio Doctrine,"" the presidential hopeful said he was guided by three principles: ""American strength,"" ""the protection of the American economy in a globalized world"" and ""moral clarity regarding America’s core values.""From his seat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Rubio has already played a key role in U.S. foreign policy debates, often staking out positions that directly counter President Barack Obama's administration.The son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio has challenged Obama's efforts to normalize diplomatic relations with the island, saying that closer ties would only help the communist Castro government keep power.In Wednesday's speech the senator also took a swipe at Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton, calling her tenure as secretary of state ""ineffective at best and dangerously negligent at worst.""Journalist Charlie Rose asked Rubio after the speech whether invoking Kennedy and the Cold War might make him appear backward-looking at a time that Rubio's campaign portrays other U.S. leaders as “trapped in the past.""Rubio also told Rose he would not have authorized the 2003 invasion of Iraq that toppled Saddam Hussein's regine if he knew Hussein did not have weapons of mass destruction.“Not only would I have not been in favor of it, but President [George W.] Bush wouldn’t have been in favor of it,” Rubio said.Bush’s brother Jeb, who has all but formally announced his bid for the Republican presidential nomination, raised eyebrows Monday after telling Fox News he supported the invasion even now that he knows Iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction.",left
"WASHINGTON – Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign on Friday released a statement from her doctor declaring she is in “excellent physical condition and fit to serve as president of the United States,” along with eight years of tax returns showing the Clintons paid tens of millions of dollars in federal taxes.The release comes on the same day the State Department released thousands of emails relating to her tenure as secretary of state.In the tax returns, released late Friday afternoon, the documents show the Clintons have paid $43 million in federal taxes since 2007.The Clintons' effective federal tax rate for 2014 was 35.7 percent, while the effective tax rate for federal, state and local taxes was 45.8 percent.Meanwhile, the statement on her health, from Dr. Lisa Bardack, an internist and chairman of the Department of Medicine at the Mount Kisco Medical Group in Mount Kisco, New York, said the former secretary of state has seasonal pollen allergies and listed ""deep vein thrombosis,"" an elbow fracture and her 2012 concussion in her recent medical history.As a result, Clinton experienced double vision and wore glasses with a Fresnel prism for two months.In 2013, she tested “negative” for all clotting disorders, though continues a daily anticoagulation as a precaution, Bardack said.Clinton’s current medications also include Armour Thyroid, which is used to treat underactive thyroids, antihistamines and Vitamin B12.She doesn’t smoke, drinks occasionally and eats a diet rich in protein.At her most recent physical on March 21, her blood pressure was 100/65 and her heart rate was 72.“(Clinton’s) cancer screening evaluations are all negative,” Bardack added.. “She is in excellent physical condition and fit to serve as president of the United States.”Clinton’s camp is touting the fact she is the first 2016 candidate to release any kind of health information, though she only officially released a one-and-a-half-page letter from her doctor.Both these releases come as the State Department releases thousands of pages of emails from her time running the department.The State Department has made available several hundred pages of documents in prior releases related to the 2012 terrorist attacks in Benghazi, Libya, and other issues.",center

"Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, moving to address a growing political firestorm over a religious freedom law enacted last week, said over the weekend that he would seek legislation to clarify the intent of the law, and rejected assertions that it sanctioned discrimination against gays and lesbians.The governor, a Republican, told The Indianapolis Star on Saturday that he was taken aback by negative reactions to the state’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which he signed into law on Thursday.The law aims to protect individuals or companies from being forced to take actions that impose a substantial burden on their religious beliefs.“I support religious liberty, and I support this law,” the governor said.Mr. Pence appeared on ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday, and the host, George Stephanopoulos, asked him whether signing the law was a mistake.“Absolutely not,” Mr. Pence said, adding later: “I signed the bill.But his answers to other questions were less clear.On Saturday, thousands of protesters gathered at the Statehouse as businesses and other governments announced a halt to business with the state and the capital, Indianapolis, over the law.Marc Benioff, the chief executive officer of Salesforce.com, said on Thursday that his company would halt all corporate travel to Indiana.The same day, Bill Oesterle, the chief executive officer of Angie’s List, said his company would abandon a deal with Indiana and Indianapolis to expand its headquarters.The debate cast a shadow over preparations in Indianapolis for the N.C.A.A. men’s basketball tournament, which will take place in Indianapolis on Saturday and next Monday.“We intend to closely examine the implications of this bill and how it might affect future events as well as our work force,” he said.The backlash has been an unexpected political headache for Mr. Pence, who is juggling whether to run for re-election or for president in 2016.Defending the law in the interviews with The Star and Mr. Stephanopoulos, the governor pointed to its origins in federal legislation signed by President Bill Clinton and adopted by about 19 other states.Critics also note that in many of the states with similar laws, including Illinois, sexual orientation is protected under civil rights law.When asked if he would seek those protections, the governor said that he would not.",left

Dick Durbin, of Illinois, and Dianne Feinstein, of California, that he regrets the invitation has been perceived by some to be political or partisan.""I can assure you that my sole intention in accepting it was to voice Israel's grave concerns about a potential nuclear agreement with Iran that could threaten the survival of my country,"" he told the senators in a letter.U.S. officials suggest Netanyahu’s trip is aimed primarily at derailing a nuclear deal with Iran, a signature Obama foreign policy objective.While Netanyahu has long been skeptical of the negotiations, his opposition has increased over what he sees as Obama's willingness to make concessions that would leave Iran on the brink of being able to build a nuclear weapon.Vice President Biden won't attend the Netanyahu speech.But Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., called Biden’s absence “appalling and unacceptable.”""I don’t know where Joe Biden will be or what he will be doing, but I can’t believe it’s more important than being in the chamber and listening to our best ally in the region -- Israel -- about the biggest threat to mankind, a nuclear-armed Iran. ...Durbin said he regretted that Netanyahu could not meet with the Democrats.""We offered the prime minister an opportunity to balance the politically divisive invitation from Speaker Boehner.""

"Hillary Rodham Clinton on Friday released her most recent eight years of tax returns, showing that she and former President Bill Clinton earned $139 million in adjusted gross income from 2007 to 2014.The spate of voluntary disclosures on Friday, intended to highlight Mrs. Clinton’s efforts at transparency, came after a week of renewed attention to her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state.In a statement, Mrs. Clinton highlighted the millions of dollars she said she and her husband had paid in taxes and given to charity, while lamenting what she called a lopsided tax code that favors wealthy people like them.The Clintons have grown immensely better off in the 15 years since they left the White House, primarily through book deals, paid speeches and other business ventures involving Mr. Clinton.Mrs. Clinton has devoted a fair amount of time since April, when she began her second presidential campaign, to showing she understands the needs of working-class Americans, who have not seen their wages grow in years, and those struggling in the post-recession job market.That effort was made particularly urgent after Mrs. Clinton said last year that she and her husband were “dead broke” when they left the White House.The Clintons have previously released their tax returns for the period from 1977, when they entered public life, through 2006.The new ones show that from 2007 through 2014 the couple paid $43,885,310 in federal taxes, for an effective tax rate of 31.55 percent.All but $190,450 of their personal charitable giving passed through their philanthropic entity, the Clinton Family Foundation, the returns show.Among Mrs. Clinton’s disclosures Friday was that she was paid $9.68 million in 2013 for 41 speeches, all in the United States except for two in Toronto.She gave three speeches to Goldman Sachs in 2013 and was paid a total of $675,000 for them; her husband was paid $200,000 by Goldman Sachs for a speech in New York, two days after Mrs. Clinton spoke to the bank in South Carolina, according to an accompanying list of his 2013 speaking fees.In all, Mr. Clinton earned $13.17 million in 2013, also for 41 speeches, the most lucrative of these, at $750,000, for addressing Handelsbanken Capital Markets in Stockholm that May; Mr. Clinton listed a second payment of $100,000 from the same company the same day.Besides the royalties from his books and his speaking fees, Mr. Clinton earned nearly $20 million between 2011 and 2014 for advising or consulting companies.“We’ve come a long way from my days going door to door for the Children’s Defense Fund and earning $16,450 as a young law professor in Arkansas — and we owe it to the opportunities America provides,” Mrs. Clinton said in her statement.Her aides hope to set up a favorable contrast for her with former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, a leading Republican contender, who has argued he is more transparent than she is.A month ago, when Mr. Bush released his own tax returns, he said: “One fun fact I learned in this process: I have paid a higher tax rate than the Clintons even though I earned less income.”Mr. Bush said his average federal tax rate was 36 percent, and contrasted that with what he said was the Clintons’ 2014 tax rate: 30 percent.Mrs. Clinton’s tax return showed that her 2014 federal tax rate was 35.72, and, with city and state income taxes, was a combined rate of 45.8 percent.",center
"The Obama Doctrine is a slightly saltier version of “Don’t Do Stupid Stuff.”And on Wednesday, in a speech before the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida and a 2016 presidential candidate, will outline his own approach to foreign policy.The Rubio approach, according to excerpts from his speech provided by his campaign, has three main pillars — ensuring American strength; protecting the American economy in a globalized world; and preserving the moral clarity of America’s core values.Mr. Rubio’s first priority will be to “adequately fund” the nation’s military.Mr. Rubio, who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations and Senate Intelligence committees, has used his time in Congress to burnish his foreign policy credits and cast himself as a defense hawk: a position that could help him stand out in a crowded primary field.In his speech, he will promise to use American power “to oppose any violations of international waters, airspace, cyberspace or outer space,” including the “economic disruption caused when one country invades another,” according to excerpts.And, Mr. Rubio will offer his greater vision of the country’s broader role in the world.“As president, I will support the spread of economic and political freedom, reinforce our alliances, resist efforts by large powers to subjugate their smaller neighbors, maintain a robust commitment to transparent and effective foreign assistance programs, and advance the rights of the vulnerable, including women and the religious minorities that are so often persecuted, so that the afflicted peoples of the world know the truth: The American people hear their cries, see their suffering and most of all, desire their freedom,” he is expected to say.",center
"Hillary Clinton said Sunday the problems that Congress has with President Obama’s trade agenda should be an opportunity for the president to ask fellow Democrats about their concerns with the proposal but still declined to say whether she supports or opposes the legislation.""Let's take the lemons and turn it into lemonade,"" Clinton told about 600 supporters at the Iowa State Fairgrounds, addressing the controversial Trans Pacific Partnership trade proposal that has splintered Obama from House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and rank-and-file Democrats.The legislation would give the president “fast-track” authority to approve pending trade deals with 11 Pacific Rim nations.Courting Iowa voters, Clinton sought to address Democratic opponents of the trade legislation, including liberals and labor unions, who have said the Obama-backed plan will cost U.S. jobs.""The president should listen to and work with his allies in Congress, starting with Nancy Pelosi, who had expressed their concerns about the impact that a weak agreement would have on our workers to make sure we get the best strongest deal possible,"" Clinton said.The White House and Republican leaders in Congress now face long odds in trying to revive the trade legislation after congressional Democrats helped defeat a job retraining program to jeopardize Obama's attempt to secure the fast-track authority.Clinton appeared to be seeking a middle ground, saying while some support the deal and others vehemently oppose it, ""I kind of fall in the group that says ‘what's in it?’ And ‘let's make it as good as it can be, and then let's make a decision.’ ”She said Obama had an ""amazing opportunity"" to negotiate better terms and reiterated the criteria of worker protections, wages and national security provisions she would seek in a final deal.Clinton said any deal should include the scuttled Trade Adjustment Assistance program to help retrain workers.Trade has emerged as an early divider within the Democratic primary.Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, who was campaigning in Iowa on Sunday, has opposed the trade deal and questioned Clinton's refusal to say where she stood.""It is a failed trade policy, and I would hope that the Secretary joins Elizabeth Warren, and vast majority of Democrats in the Congress in saying, ‘No, we've got to defeat this piece of legislation,’ ” Sanders said on CBS' ""Face the Nation.""Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley has also opposed the deal.The Obama administration has said it remains confident there are ways to get the trade provisions through Congress.Republican leaders generally support Obama's trade proposal and have suggested they may try to revive the bill as early as this week.""Republicans delivered,"" Wisconsin GOP Rep. Paul Ryan, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said on ""Fox News Sunday.""While Clinton called the pact the ""gold standard"" of trade agreements while serving as secretary of state, she has refused to take a position on the deal since announcing her candidacy.That brought criticism from Republican National Committee spokesman Michael Short on Sunday.""By waffling on a trade deal she helped negotiate and once called a ""gold standard,"" Hillary Clinton continues to show why voters overwhelmingly see her as dishonest and untrustworthy,"" Short said in a statement.Clinton was spending most of the weekend in Iowa after formally launching her campaign in New York City, seeking to build an organizational edge in the state that tripped up her first presidential campaign against Obama.Sanders was campaigning across the state and former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb, who is exploring a potential Democratic bid, also was holding events in Iowa on Sunday.Earlier in the day, top Clinton advisers, including senior spokeswoman Karen Finney, said that Clinton is waiting to see the final deal and that she has explained her position in recent weeks.""We’ll see where this process goes,"" Finney told Fox News.Campaign Chairman John Podesta told NBC’s “Meet the Press” that Clinton “has a clear standard that (the deal) has got to be good for American workers or she thinks the United States should walk away from it.”",center

"WASHINGTON -- The House Select Committee on Benghazi sent a formal interview request to Hillary Clinton’s lawyer on Tuesday regarding emails she exchanged during her time as secretary of state.In a letter to the Clinton’s lawyer, Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), the committee chairman, said the committee is not interested in emails relating to personal or private matters, and instead will focus solely on those pertaining to “Libya and Benghazi during the relevant time periods.”“Toward that end and because of the Secretary’s unique arrangement with herself as it relates to public records during and after her tenure as Secretary of State, this Committee is left with no alternative but to request Secretary Clinton appear before this Committee for a transcribed interview to better understand decisions the Secretary made relevant to the creation, maintenance, retention, and ultimately deletion of public records,” Gowdy stated in the letter.Gowdy set a May 1 deadline for the interview.An interview, Gowdy argued, would provide protection for the likely 2016 presidential candidate’s privacy and security for sensitive information.The request comes after reports revealed Clinton used a private email address and a server located in her New York home during her time as secretary of state.Gowdy said once Clinton is interviewed and all documents related to the 2012 Benghazi attack are shared, the committee will schedule a time for Clinton to testify publicly in a hearing.“We share the Secretary’s desire these two conversations take place as quickly and efficiently as possible, and are willing to expedite both working with your office, the Secretary’s schedule and our Democrat colleagues on the Committee,” Gowdy said.Gowdy went on to call Clinton’s email situation “highly unusual, if not unprecedented,” and said it “exacerbates” lawmakers’ needs to “understand what the Secretary did.”Earlier this month, Clinton said she had a private email account because she “thought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal emails instead of two.”She admitted that “looking back,” it would have been better to carry the second phone.Clinton is not the only government official to use a private email for work.",center

"WASHINGTON — As State Department lawyers sifted last summer through a new batch of documents related to the Benghazi attacks, they repeatedly saw something that caught their attention: emails sent to and from a personal account for Hillary Rodham Clinton.The lawyers, according to current and former State Department officials, were working to respond to a request from a specially appointed House committee investigating the 2012 attacks in Libya.“This all raised the question to us: What else are we missing, and what do we need to comply” with the request, said one official briefed on the matter.Mrs. Clinton’s spokesman and the State Department have cast her decision to hand over her emails as motivated by efforts to update the department’s record management system.But it was the review of Benghazi-related documents last summer that, within the State Department, set off the chain of events leading to the public disclosure this week of Mrs. Clinton’s use of a private email account, according to the current and former department officials.The decision to ask Mrs. Clinton for her emails went all the way to Secretary of State John Kerry’s chief of staff, who, along with officials working on the response to the Benghazi requests, signed off on it.Beginning in August, senior State Department officials held negotiations with Mrs. Clinton’s lawyers and advisers to gain access to her personal email records.In October, the State Department sent a letter to Mrs. Clinton and all former secretaries of state back to Madeleine K. Albright, seeking emails and other documents in their possession that related to their government work.Finally, in December, dozens of boxes filled with 50,000 pages of printed emails from Mrs. Clinton’s personal account were delivered to the State Department.Three weeks ago, the State Department handed over the Benghazi emails to the House Select Committee on Benghazi, which is led by Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina.Mrs. Clinton’s spokesman, Mr. Merrill, did not respond to an email seeking comment.Late Wednesday night, two days after The New York Times first reported that she had exclusively used a personal email account as secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton announced that she had asked the State Department to release those communications.“I want the public to see my email,” Mrs. Clinton wrote in a Twitter post shortly before midnight, addressing the issue publicly for the first time.Mrs. Clinton’s decision leaves it to the State Department to determine whether parts of her correspondence should be redacted if they contain information that could be damaging to national security, or for other reasons.That process could take several months, officials said, because different parts of the State Department must weigh in on whether information should be redacted.While the State Department has said there does not appear to be any classified material in Mrs. Clinton’s emails, officials said on Thursday that they needed to go through the trove again to determine whether it contained any “sensitive” information.Sensitive information is different from classified information.One State Department official said that if many lawyers were dedicated to the project, it could be completed in several weeks.Since the disclosure that Mrs. Clinton used the private account, a spokeswoman for the State Department has described the request from Mrs. Clinton as part of the department’s larger efforts to improve its record-keeping.“The letter actually went before we got the request from the select committee,” Ms. Harf said of the request to the former secretaries.Ms. Harf said that Mrs. Clinton was the only secretary of state who had sent back copies of emails.",center
"Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton used a personal email account to exclusively conduct official business during her time at the State Department, a move that raises questions about access to the full archive of her correspondence, as well as the possibility that she violated federal law requiring official messages to be retained for the record.The existence of the account was discovered by the House select committee investigating the deadly 2012 attacks on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, and was first reported by The New York Times.Clinton did not even have a government email address during her tenure as America's top diplomat, which lasted from 2009 to 2013, and The Times reports that her aides took no action to preserve her emails on department servers, as required by the Federal Records Act.Instead, the paper reports, Clinton's advisers selected which of her emails to turn over to the State Department for archival purposes after going through tens of thousands of pages of correspondence.It is not clear how many total emails from that period were in Clinton's personal account, nor is it clear how Clinton's advisers decided which emails to hand over to the State Department.Nick Merrill, a Clinton spokesman, said the former secretary of state expected that emails to State Department officials -- which she sent to department accounts -- would be preserved.The fate of emails to foreign leaders, private citizens, and non-State Department officials is unclear.""The State Department has long had access to a wide array of Secretary Clinton's records -- including emails between her and Department officials with state.gov accounts,"" State Department Deputy Spokesperson Marie Harf told Fox News late Monday.According to the Times, however, while past secretaries of state often used personal email, updated regulations required such emails to be preserved.Clinton and her aides reportedly did not follow that requirement at the time -- until her office turned over documents.Republicans seized on the developments on Tuesday.""The use of a personal e-mail address to skirt public records laws, aside from failing to meet the security standards one would expect of the nation's top diplomat, enabled Clinton to shield her official communications from scrutiny by the media and the American public,"" he said.White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest was peppered with questions at Tuesday's briefing.He said the administration policy is that employees ""should use their official email accounts when they're conducting official government business.""Earnest would not say whether the White House believes Clinton broke the law.Records officials interviewed by The Times expressed grave concern over Clinton's practice, saying it represents a severe ethical breach and noting that personal email accounts are far less secure than official ones.Jason Baron, a former director of litigation at the National Archives, told the paper he found it ""very difficult to conceive of a scenario — short of nuclear winter — where an agency would be justified in allowing its cabinet-level head officer to solely use a private email communications channel for the conduct of government business.""However, The Times reports that the imposition of penalties for not complying with federal record-keeping requirements are rare because the National Archives has so few enforcement mechanisms.The report has drawn heavy criticism from Republicans, including at least one potential challenger in the 2016 presidential race.Clinton is widely believed to be the front-runner for the Democratic nomination in 2016.",center
"DES MOINES – Hillary Rodham Clinton on Sunday urged President Obama to listen to congressional Democrats – particular the House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi – and make changes to the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal that reflect their concerns about protecting American jobs and wages.In her first detailed comments on the trade deal since the House of Representatives refused on Friday to allow Mr. Obama to negotiate it freely, Mrs. Clinton laid out a far more calibrated position on the deal than many Democrats and Republicans have taken.She argued that the House vote gave Mr. Obama “this amazing opportunity” to seek concessions from Pacific trading partners to salvage the deal.“The president should listen to and work with his allies in Congress, starting with Nancy Pelosi, who have expressed their concerns about the impact that a weak agreement would have on our workers to make sure we get the best, strongest deal possible,” Mrs. Clinton said at a rally here.“And if we don’t get it, there should be no deal,” she added.Mrs. Clinton indicated that if she were president, she would not abandon the 12-nation Pacific trade deal – as some Democrats want – but would use the opposition in Congress as negotiating leverage.“I am willing to try now to see whether you can push to get rid of the objectionable parts, to drive a harder bargain on some of the other parts,” Mrs. Clinton said at the rally, her first here as a candidate for the 2016 presidential nomination.Mrs. Clinton has been criticized by Republicans and some Democrats for saying little about the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal in recent weeks, especially since she had made favorable comments about it as secretary of state.A few hours before Mrs. Clinton’s remarks, Mr. Sanders repeated his challenge to her to oppose the trade agreement.“I would hope that the secretary joins Elizabeth Warren, Sherrod Brown and the vast majority of Democrats in the Congress in saying, ‘No, we have got to defeat this piece of legislation,’ ” Mr. Sanders said on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” referring to fellow senators.Without naming names, Mrs. Clinton sought to distinguish herself from Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, as well as from fervent supporters of the deal like some of the Republicans running for president.“No president would be a tougher negotiator on behalf of American workers with either our trading partners or Republicans on Capitol Hill than I would be,” Mrs. Clinton said.Mrs. Clinton invoked Ms. Pelosi’s name twice during her remarks and appeared to agree with Ms. Pelosi that “there are some specifics in there that could and should be changed.”“Let’s take the lemons and turn it into lemonade,” she said.Later on Sunday, at a house party with Democrats in Burlington, Iowa, Mrs. Clinton was more explicit in challenging Mr. Obama by setting expectations for him to work with congressional Democrats on the trade deal.“My view is the White House should call Nancy and a few other of the Democrats to say, ‘What would it take to get an agreement that would be better and not worse for American workers?’” Mrs. Clinton said, aligning herself with a potential future ally (Ms. Pelosi) over a lame-duck president.“I have held my peace because I thought it was important for the Congress to have a full debate without thrusting presidential politics and candidates into it,” Mrs. Clinton added.",center
"WASHINGTON — The chairman of the House committee investigating the Benghazi attacks asked Hillary Rodham Clinton on Tuesday to appear for a private interview about her exclusive use of a personal email account when she was secretary of state.Mrs. Clinton’s “email arrangement with herself is highly unusual, if not unprecedented,” the committee’s chairman, Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina, wrote in a letter to Mrs. Clinton’s lawyer Tuesday morning.The emails were on a server at her home in Chappaqua, N.Y. Mr. Gowdy had asked Mrs. Clinton to turn over that server to a neutral third party, like the State Department’s inspector general, to determine which emails were personal and which were government records.But in a letter to Mr. Gowdy on Friday, a lawyer for Mrs. Clinton said there was no need to turn over the server because an examination of it showed that it had no copies of emails she sent during her time as secretary of state.In October, the State Department asked former secretaries of state dating back to Madeleine Albright to provide it with any government records — like emails — they might have in their possession.Since the report by The New York Times on March 2 that Mrs. Clinton used only a personal email account and did not even have a government account, she seems to have provided two answers about whether she still has copies of her emails.At a news conference at the United Nations a little more than a week after The Times’s report, Mrs. Clinton first said she “chose not to keep” her private personal emails.Mr. Gowdy said the committee believed that “a transcribed interview would best protect Secretary Clinton’s privacy, the security of the information queried and the public’s interest in ensuring this committee has all information needed to accomplish the task set before it.”But Mrs. Clinton indicated on Tuesday that she wanted to give her testimony in a public setting.The committee’s ranking member, Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland, said the panel should hold a public hearing instead of a private interview.Mr. Gowdy has sought to prevent his inquiry into the attacks in 2012 on an American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya — and its burgeoning examination of Mrs. Clinton’s email practices — from being dismissed as a strictly partisan effort to embarrass a likely Democratic nominee for president.Some Republicans on Capitol Hill — including Mr. Gowdy — are growing frustrated with Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, who they contend is politicizing the email issue.“I mean, you cannot just destroy documents when an agency is telling you to turn them over,” Mr. Priebus said on “Fox and Friends.”“Even Nixon didn’t destroy the tapes,” Mr. Priebus said, referring to the Watergate scandal that ultimately led to President Richard M. Nixon’s resignation.In an interview Tuesday, Mr. Gowdy said Mr. Priebus had overstepped his expertise.“As far as I know, he’s not an expert in federal record-keeping law,” Mr. Gowdy said of Mr. Priebus.“We don’t know enough facts, so why speculate?” Mr. Gowdy added.",center
"LIVINGSTON, N.J. — Gov. Chris Christie declared an uphill candidacy for president on Tuesday with New Jersey-style swagger, unconcealed disgust for Washington and a high regard for his own candor, vowing that “there is one thing you will know for sure: I say what I mean and I mean what I say.”Relying on his biggest, and perhaps his last, remaining advantage in a field of better-financed and better-liked rivals — his personality — Mr. Christie portrayed himself as the only candidate in the Republican field who is forthright and forceful enough to run the country.“We need strength and decision-making and authority back in the Oval Office,” he said.Pacing the stage without a prepared text and raising his voice to a shout at times, he vowed to campaign and govern as a colorful teller of difficult truths, even if “it makes you cringe every once in a while.”“I am not running for president of the United States as surrogate for being elected prom king of America,” Mr. Christie said inside the gymnasium at the high school where he was president of his class all three years.“I am not going to be the most popular guy who looks into your eye every day and says what you want to hear,” he continued.Trying to claw his way back to the top of the Republican field, Mr. Christie took a pointed swipe at his rivals who are in the United States Senate, like Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, who have never run a state government.“Unlike some people who offer themselves for president in 2016, you won’t have to wonder whether I can do it or not,” he said, invoking the “economic calamity” he said he inherited in 2010 and the “unprecedented natural disaster,” Hurricane Sandy, that he weathered as governor.But he reserved his deepest disdain for Congress and for the president’s stewardship of foreign affairs, and extended that critique to President Obama’s former secretary of state.“After seven years of a weak and feckless foreign policy run by Barack Obama, we better not turn it over to his second mate, Hillary Clinton,” Mr. Christie said.Still, he blamed both parties for dysfunction and gridlock in Washington.Mr. Christie, whose dazzling rise as a national Republican in his first term was matched only by his spectacular loss of stature at home in his second, entered the presidential race bearing little resemblance to the candidate he once expected to be.The economic recovery he promised has turned into a cascade of ugly credit downgrades and anemic job growth.Three and a half years ago, Mr. Christie seemed such an antidote to all that ailed the Republican brand that senior figures in the party pleaded with him to run for president as a substitute for the eventual nominee, Mitt Romney.But now, a staggering 55 percent of Republican primary voters say that they cannot envision voting for Mr. Christie, according to an NBC-Wall Street Journal Poll.With two pillars of his presidential run — his record and his judgment — looking wobbly, Mr. Christie must now build a campaign around his most raw and prodigious asset: his personality, a magnetic mix of quick-witted charm, insult-trading banter, vulnerability, empathy and effrontery.It was on vivid display Tuesday before hundreds of supporters, including many of Mr. Christie’s oldest friends and most loyal aides.“The lying and stealing has already happened, the horse is out of the barn, we need to get it back in, and the only way to do it is by force,” he said.Mr. Christie, 52, honed his political technique, and developed a YouTube following, during a remarkable run of 137 town-hall-style meetings across New Jersey.Such single-mindedness belies the serious and stubborn vulnerabilities of his campaign.As a centrist candidate from the Northeast, he would have a difficult path to the Republican presidential nomination under the best circumstances.At his announcement, Mr. Christie sought political rebirth, as he has before, by relying on his powers as a narrator, and mythologizer, of his own story.Running for president is a new and bigger stage, though, and both Mr. Christie’s stagecraft and his oratory showed room for improvement.Without a text, Mr. Christie frequently descended into clichés.But he also spoke with emotional power, as when he recalled his father’s early job in an ice cream factory in Newark.“Think about how amazing this country is,” Mr. Christie said.The question for Mr. Christie, after a bruising year of watching his story rewritten by others, may be whether Republican voters, who can choose from among a long and intriguing list of fresher faces, will give him a fighting chance to sell himself anew.",center
"New York – In his first major foreign policy speech since launching his presidential campaign, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio said if elected, he would prioritize a strong military, take aggressive steps to fight nations that undermine global commerce and ensure that U.S. is a world moral leader.The Florida Republican, who delivered his speech at the Council on Foreign Relations in Manhattan on Wednesday, said that the United States was losing its place as a world military and moral power because of what he depicted as the Obama administration’s overly cautious responses to crises overseas.“Since the end of the Cold War, the threats facing America have changed, but the need for American strength has not,” Rubio said.“It takes forethought to design and many years to build the capabilities we may need at a moment’s notice,"" the 43-year-old said.Rubio repeated his characterization of Obama as a president so concerned with softening any perception other nations has of the United States as a bully that he erred in acting in the other extreme, eager to acquiesce to foreign governments that have thumbed their noses at the U.S. and international laws.“[Obama] demonstrated a disregard for our moral purpose that at times flirted with disdain,” said Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants.Rubio also said that the United States must move decisively when aggressive nations such as China and Iran attempt to undermine the economic interests of the United States as well as other nations.""Russia, China, Iran or any other nation that attempts to block global commerce will know to expect a response from my administration.”The Democratic National Committee issued a brief statement shortly after Rubio's speech:“Okay. So here’s Rubio’s alleged ‘new’ foreign policy.And it ended with: “Neoconservative meets Cold War: that’s the Rubio doctrine.”Rubio’s foreign policy agenda – often hawkish in approach – has been a hallmark of his service in the Senate, and now in his campaign.Rubio said Obama ""wasted no time stripping parts from the engine of American strength,"" and cast former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as his loyal deputy.""[Clinton] was the chief architect of a foreign policy that was a disaster,"" he said during an interview with Charlie Rose following the speech.""We simply cannot afford to elect as our next president one of the leading agents of this administration's foreign policy — a leader from yesterday whose tenure as secretary of state was ineffective at best and dangerously negligent at worst,"" Rubio said, according to the prepared text of remarks he was to deliver at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.He even has taken tougher stances on foreign policy than some of his Republican colleagues, who have softened their views on diplomatic relations with Cuba – to which Rubio objects – and how to handle the nuclear talks with Iran.Some in the GOP have called for spending cuts in military spending, with which he disagrees.As he often has in Senate hearings, Rubio assailed Obama for stressing dialogues and diplomacy over ironclad dealings with heads of foreign governments that have been openly hostile to the United States, and which continue to exercise oppression against political dissidents.“The world is at its safest when America is at its strongest,” Rubio said.Rubio said, after his speech, in a question-and-answer session with TV host Charlie Rose, that ""Obama has embraced regimes that systematically opposed our principles.""Rose asked Rubio what he though of Pope Francis's embrace of diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Cuba.Rubio said his priorities and those of the pope's are by necessity different.He defended keeping the embargo.He said having anything to do with Cuba is to avail oneself of properties stolen from Cubans by the Cuban government during the revolution.Rubio said the embargo is not to blame for Cuba's failed economy.He said the rest of the world does not have an embargo against Cuba.As for Iran, Rubio said it cannot be trusted.""Iran has always had a secret component to its nuclear program,"" he said.",left
"Arkansas Gov.

Mike Pence (R) last week.In a Wednesday press conference announcing his opposition to the initial version of the bill, Hutchinson said his son had asked him to veto the legislation.""My son Seth signed the petition asking me, Dad, the governor, to veto this bill,"" he said.Hutchinson also faced pressure from Walmart, which is headquartered in the state.",right

"Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee announced Tuesday he is running for president, delivering an economy- and security-centered message that he hopes will appeal to everyday Americans and distinguish him from the already-crowded Republican field.Huckabee, who is embarking on his second presidential run, made the announcement in his hometown of Hope, Ark.“Folks cannot seem to get ahead or even stay even,” he said.Huckabee, a former Baptist minister, ran for president in 2008, winning eight states including the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses before running out of money and exiting the race.“Folks, it’s a long way from a little brick rented house on Second Street in Hope, Arkansas, to the White House,” he said.The 59-year-old Huckabee has a strong following among the party’s evangelical Christian base but this time will face stiff competition for that vote from such primary candidates as Dr. Ben Carson and Sen. Ted Cruz, of Texas.He frequently repeated the phrase, “Hope to higher ground,” which appears to be a slogan of sorts for his 2016 campaign.He also took a swipe at President Obama for declining to recognize the Islamic State group as radical Islamic terrorists and vowed to stop them.""I wonder if he can watch a Western from the '50s and be able to figure out who the good guy and the bad guys really are,"" Huckabee said.He also vowed to protect Medicare and give states more of a say in government and education.Huckabee, who left his job as a Fox News host earlier this year in preparation for a potential 2016 run, was Arkansas governor from 1996 to 2007, serving after Bill Clinton, who also is from Hope.Even before the speech, Huckabee was trying to position himself as the GOP candidate best equipped to defeat Hillary Clinton, the Democratic frontrunner.In a recent campaign video, Huckabee argued that in his more than 10 years as governor, he took on Democrats in ""Bill Clinton's Arkansas"" after then-candidate Bill Clinton won election to the White House in 1992.""Every day in my life in politics was a fight,"" Huckabee says in the video, released as a preview of his Tuesday announcement.The field of confirmed and potential GOP presidential candidates includes more than a dozen people.A new NBC/ Wall Street Journal poll of GOP primary voters shows 23 percent picked former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush as their first choice.Bush is followed in the poll by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio with 18 percent, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker with 14 percent, Cruz and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul with 11 percent, Carson with 7 percent, Huckabee and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie at 5 percent, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry at 2 percent and former Hewlett-Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina at 1 percent.Huckabee is the third Republican this week to announce a 2016 White House bid, following Fiorina and Carson, a retired neurosurgeon They join Cruz, Paul and Rubio.Campaign aides say Huckabee’s path to winning the party nomination this time will be to appeal to working-class cultural conservatives, pitching their candidate as an economic populist and foreign affairs hawk who holds deeply conservative views on social issues such as abortion and gay marriage.Huckabee advocates a national consumption tax, which is similar to a sales tax, to replace the existing federal taxes on personal income and payrolls.On immigration, he insists on a secure border and bemoans the presence of millions of people who are living in the country illegally, though he favors a creating a path to citizenship for children of immigrant parents who brought them to the U.S. illegally.Like other Republican White House hopefuls, Huckabee is sharply critical of Obama's foreign policy.But whatever the issue, Huckabee, also an author, wraps his appeal as a pitch to everyday Americans who he says ""don't feel like anybody understands or knows who they are, much less cares what's happening to them.""Evangelical Christian voters helped Huckabee win the Iowa caucuses in 2008 and finish a strong second in South Carolina, the largest of the early-voting states.He would need to replicate that early success to create an opening to build a wider coalition and compete deep into the primary schedule.",left
"Hillary and Bill Clinton earned roughly $141 million and paid nearly $44 million in federal income taxes from 2007 to 2014, according to tax returns released Friday.The former secretary of state and Democratic presidential candidate released the tax returns on her campaign website, along with her health records and a list of paid speeches she and her husband gave.Last year, the Clintons paid an effective federal tax rate of 35.7 percent and donated over 10 percent of their income to charity.""We’ve come a long way from my days going door to door for the Children’s Defense Fund and earning $16,450 as a young law professor in Arkansas—and we owe it to the opportunities America provides,"" Clinton said in a statement accompanying the returns.The Clintons have previously released their tax returns dating back to 1977.Clinton's release comes about one month after Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush released 33 years of returns, showing his net worth between $19 and $22 million.In May, Hillary Clinton filed a disclosure with the Federal Elections Commission showing the couple had earned approximately $30 million from book sales and speeches in 2014 and the first four months of 2015.",right
"Mike Huckabee, a former Republican governor of Arkansas and preacher who has announced his run for the presidency on Tuesday, has been outspoken on a range of matters, particularly foreign policy and social issues like same-sex marriage.Mr. Huckabee warns that radical Islam is a grave threat to the United States and says President Obama too frequently defends Islam.A strong defender of Israel, he has been sharply critical of Mr. Obama’s treatment of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and said a proposed nuclear deal with Iran is “terrible” because Iran cannot be trusted.As governor of Arkansas in 2002, he called for lifting the economic embargo of Cuba, which would have helped rice farmers in his state.In 2007 Mr. Huckabee was quoted as saying, “Climate change is here, it’s real.” But more recently he has minimized it as a threat, and said he opposes “cap and trade” legislation meant to curtail carbon emissions.Mr. Huckabee opposes same-sex marriage, suggesting as recently as February that homosexuality is a lifestyle choice akin to drinking or swearing.Mr. Huckabee said Mr. Obama exceeded his authority by issuing executive actions shielding millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation.Mr. Huckabee has focused his economic message on what he calls wage stagnation under Mr. Obama.Unlike other Republican candidates, Mr. Huckabee is a strong defender of entitlement programs, opposing plans to raise the retirement age for collecting Social Security and criticizing plans to curtail Medicare.",center
"WASHINGTON — Susan E. Rice, President Obama’s national security adviser, sharply criticized Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Tuesday over his plans to address a joint meeting of Congress next week, saying his actions had hurt his nation’s relationship with the United States.Mr. Netanyahu’s decision to travel to Washington to deliver the speech two weeks before the Israeli elections has “injected a degree of partisanship, which is not only unfortunate, I think it’s destructive of the fabric of the relationship,” Ms. Rice said in an interview on the PBS television program “Charlie Rose.”Her comments marked the strongest public rebuke to date by the Obama administration since Mr. Netanyahu accepted an invitation from Speaker John A. Boehner to make his case to Congress against a nuclear deal with Iran, which is a priority of Mr. Obama’s.The speech, scheduled for March 3, was arranged by Mr. Boehner and the Israeli ambassador without consulting the White House — a move that Mr. Obama’s team has called a breach of protocol.The president has said he will not meet with Mr. Netanyahu during his visit to avoid any appearance that he is trying to influence the Israeli elections that are scheduled for mid-March.The episode is a low point in the tense relationship between Mr. Obama and Mr. Netanyahu and has touched off weeks of mostly anonymous sniping and finger-pointing.Top administration officials have hinted more openly of their displeasure in recent days.The White House on Wednesday said that Mr. Obama agreed with Ms. Rice’s assessment, saying he had raised the same concerns several times.Her comments, said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, are “entirely consistent with what the president has already said.”“Allowing this relationship to be subjected to party politics does weaken the relationship,” Mr. Earnest said.Mr. Earnest said he did not know whether Mr. Obama and Ms. Rice had talked in advance of the interview about what she would say about Mr. Netanyahu’s visit.Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who as president of the Senate would be expected to attend, has said he will be traveling abroad.The Israeli prime minister himself has turned down a request by Democratic senators for a private meeting, Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, said Tuesday.“We offered the prime minister an opportunity to balance the politically divisive invitation from Speaker Boehner with a private meeting with Democrats who are committed to keeping the bipartisan support of Israel strong,” Mr. Durbin said in a statement.In a letter released by Mr. Durbin’s office, Mr. Netanyahu said such a meeting “could compound the misperception of partisanship regarding my upcoming visit.”Mr. Netanyahu said Tuesday that he was making the trip because it was his obligation to “do everything I can to prevent” a nuclear agreement with Iran.“Therefore, I will go to Washington to address the American Congress, because the American Congress is likely to be the final brake before the agreement between the major powers and Iran,” he said as he toured a military base in southern Israel.Ms. Rice demurred when asked whether she believed Mr. Netanyahu was making the speech to gain political favor.“I’m not going to ascribe motives to the prime minister,” she told Mr. Rose.“We’ve worked very hard to have that,” she said, “and we will work very hard to maintain that.”",right
"When Gov. Asa Hutchinson, Republican of Arkansas, spoke on Wednesday about the future of what proponents call the religious freedom bill pending in his state, he disclosed that the proposal had drawn resistance from a particularly noteworthy critic: his son, Seth Hutchinson.But to people familiar with the Hutchinsons, long one of the most influential families in Arkansas, the news was hardly a bombshell.“It would be surprising to me if he didn’t do that,” said Shawn Standefer, a childhood friend of the younger Mr. Hutchinson who captained their national championship-winning Quiz Bowl team in high school.And so it was on Saturday, with lawmakers nearing a vote on the legislation that critics said would legalize discrimination against gay people, that the younger Mr. Hutchinson wrote to his father and warned that the proposal could damage Arkansas’s reputation and economy.“I love my dad, and we have a good, close relationship,” Seth Hutchinson said on Wednesday.Mr. Hutchinson has not always been what he described as the family’s political “black sheep.”“I kind of grew up on the campaign trail,” he said.But, starting when he was about 15 and working as a dishwasher at a diner, Mr. Hutchinson’s views began to change as he shuffled through other jobs, including stints at Chuck E. Cheese’s and Sears.“It just showed me that there’s something wrong,” he said, adding that he became interested in gay rights at about the same time, when friends began discussing their sexual orientations and after the arrest of an art teacher, who was gay.“He was not out,” Mr. Hutchinson said of the teacher.Mr. Hutchinson had robust political discussions with his father even as a high school student, long before their views diverged so vastly.“He would defend his views,” Mr. Standefer said.Mr. Hutchinson spent a year at Georgetown University before enrolling at the University of Central Arkansas, where he joined groups like the Young Democratic Socialists, and rallied for gay rights during the tenure of another Republican, Gov. Mike Huckabee.Seth Hutchinson later moved to Texas and became a labor activist, which the governor mentions to left-leaning audiences.Father and son communicate regularly, Seth Hutchinson said, and the family gathers at least once or twice a year.“It’s always a lively and engaging conversation,” Mr. Hutchinson said.On Wednesday, the governor said he would ask lawmakers to either recall or rewrite portions of the bill.“I did not sway my dad,” he said.",left
"The backlash to Indiana's new religious freedom law grew Monday, even as state lawmakers move to clarify the legislation, with Wash. Gov. Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray banning government-funded travel to Indiana.The statements are the latest boycott threats to emerge over claims that the law has the potential to discriminate against gays and others.Murray, a Democrat who is openly gay, issued his ban via executive order over the weekend, and Inslee issued his Monday afternoon.“I find Indiana’s new law disturbing, particularly at a time when more and more states and people in America are embracing civil rights for everyone,"" Inslee said in a statement.Murray says the law doesn't reflect Seattle residents’ values.“Seattleites know that discrimination has no place in our city,” he said in a statement.The primary concern is that the law might allow a business to discriminate against gay residents, such as a baker being allowed refuse an order from a gay couple for a wedding cake.But state lawmakers and Republican Gov. Mike Pence have been defending and trying to explain the Religious Freedom Restoration Act ever since the governor signed it into law on Thursday.However, the Indiana law differs in several ways, primarily in that it allows a business to assert a right to ""the free exercise of religion.""On Monday, state Senate President Pro Tem David Long and House Speaker Brian Bosma, both Republicans, held a press conference to further explain the law.“The new law does not discriminate,” Long said.Aside from Indiana, 15 other states have introduced legislation in 2015 to craft or alter their religious freedom laws.Bosma acknowledged a major concern is whether businesses will now be legally permitted to deny services to some people, as a result of the law, and that even he is unclear.“We don’t believe that will be the effect,” he said.Long and Bosma also conceded they called the press conference because Pence failed to clearly explain the law during an appearance Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.”Pence said the legislation prohibits Indiana laws that ""substantially burden"" a person's ability to follow his or her religious beliefs, with the definition of ""person"" including religious institutions, businesses and associations.However, he did not answer directly when asked six times whether, under the law, it would be legal for a merchant to refuse to serve gay customers.Long on Monday also denied that a clarification of the law would be needed before this weekend’s men’s NCAA Final Four basketball championships, in Indianapolis.A record-breaking 158,682 people attended the games last year in Texas.The NCAA, whose headquarters is in Indianapolis, also has expressed concern about the law, as figures in corporate America and Hollywood voice their opposition.“We are especially concerned about how this legislation could affect our student-athletes and employees,” said NCAA President Mark Emmert.Angie’s List, the business-rating website, this weekend put on hold plans to expand its Indianapolis headquarters.Actor George Takei is calling for a boycott.",right
"In a head-to-head battle of proxies, Vice President Biden wasted no time Thursday trying to do what many Democrats felt President Obama failed to against Mitt Romney, going on offense with an often disdainful attack on Paul Ryan -- who stood his ground against a barrage of Biden grins, guffaws, snickers and interruptions.The dueling running mates turned the lone vice presidential debate into an uncharacteristically feisty affair, scrapping over everything from the economy to Libya to taxes.If Obama was too cold, Biden at times bordered on too hot, analysts said afterward.He chuckled and smirked through many of Ryan's responses.Biden went after the Romney/Ryan ticket with a directness that Obama did not.""These people are my mom and dad, the people I grew up with, my neighbors,"" Biden said, adding he's ""had it up to here"" with those kinds of comments.Ryan shot back, in reference to Biden's tendency to make gaffes: ""As the vice president very well knows ... sometimes the words don't come out of your mouth the right way.""""But I always say what I mean,"" Biden responded.Ryan accused Obama of ""projecting weakness"" with his foreign policy, particularly in his response to the terror attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya.""This is not what a real recovery looks like,"" Ryan said.Whether the debate will alter the course of the race remains to be seen.The economy, the budget deficit and foreign policy were central.Ryan opened the debate with tough criticism of the Obama administration over its handling of the Libya terror attack.""What we are watching on our TV screens is the unraveling of the Obama foreign policy,"" Ryan said.With the moderator, ABC News' Martha Raddatz, opening the debate with a question about the Libya strike, which happened a month ago Thursday, Ryan criticized the administration for waiting more than a week after the strike to call it a coordinated terror attack.""This is becoming more troubling by the day.Biden was quick to retort: ""With all due respect, that's just a bunch of malarkey.He added: ""This talk about this weakness, I don't understand what my friend's talking about.""Biden also criticized Romney for making a ""political statement""on the night of the attack, a reference to Romney's criticism of the U.S. Embassy in Cairo's early response to protests there.The face-off Thursday night was taking on outsized importance for a vice presidential debate.After Obama's debate performance last week, the pressure was on Biden to recapture the momentum -- while equally on Ryan to prevent the Obama ticket from blunting Romney's surge.Ryan referred to the weight on Biden's shoulders about mid-way through, as the two talked over each other on Medicare.""Mr. vice president, I know you're under a lot of duress to make up for lost ground, but I think people would be better served if we don't keep interrupting each other,"" Ryan said.On Medicare, Biden charged that the Republican ticket's plan would raise costs for future seniors with a de facto ""voucher"" system.Ryan shot back: ""They got caught with their hand in the cookie jar turning Medicare into a piggy bank for ObamaCare.""The debate veered across the spectrum of topics from the campaign trail.Ryan, toward the end of the debate, warned that a ""debt crisis is coming"" and claimed the sitting president offers little more than speeches to address the deficit.""That's what we get in this administration -- speeches.In a matter of days, Romney has picked up steam in both battleground and national polls.Obama has acknowledged he had a ""bad night"" in his debate last week, but the campaign indicates it will be more aggressive going forward.The final presidential debates will be held Oct. 16 and Oct. 22.",center
"John Boehner is setting expectations high -- but apparently not too high -- for this year's congressional elections, telling Fox News that the Democrats have a chance of retaking the House.The House speaker, in an interview with Fox News to air Tuesday morning, gave his Republican Party a ""two-in-three chance"" of holding on to control of the House after taking power in the 2010 elections.""But there's a one-in-three chance we could lose,"" Boehner said.Democrats face an uphill battle in their efforts to take back the House, where Republicans hold a 242-190 seat advantage.And control of the Senate could be up for grabs this year, too, with Democrats clinging to a fragile six-vote majority.In the House, a flurry of redistricting decisions appears to be working as of late in the Democrats' favor, though the chaotic process has stung both parties repeatedly.The Democrats would need 25 seats in the House to regain the majority -- a very steep climb in a year when neither party is particularly popular.In total, 33 Senate seats are in play this year, with 23 currently held by Democrats and 10 held by Republicans.But while Republicans have several opportunities to pick off those Democrat-held seats, three races in particular could undermine those potential gains for the GOP. Republican Sens. Scott Brown in Massachusetts and Dean Heller in Nevada, who was appointed to fill the vacancy left by John Ensign, are both considered vulnerable.",right
"Representative Paul D. Ryan, the Republican chairman of the House Budget Committee, has been excoriated by some Roman Catholic leaders ever since he claimed this month that his budget plan, which slashes antipoverty programs, was inspired by the moral teachings of his Catholic faith.The latest criticism comes in a letter released Tuesday and signed by nearly 90 faculty members and priests at Georgetown, the Jesuit university in Washington, in advance of Mr. Ryan’s visit there on Thursday.The letter says, “We would be remiss in our duty to you and our students if we did not challenge your continuing misuse of Catholic teaching to defend a budget plan that decimates food programs for struggling families, radically weakens protections for the elderly and sick, and gives more tax breaks to the wealthiest few.”“Your budget appears to reflect the values of your favorite philosopher, Ayn Rand, rather than the Gospel of Jesus Christ,” says the letter, which the faculty members sent to Mr. Ryan along with a copy of the Vatican’s Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church — “to help deepen your understanding of Catholic social teaching.”The pressure on Mr. Ryan is part of an effort by some Catholic leaders who are political independents, liberals and Democrats to make it clear that the Catholic church is not an arm of the Republican Party.Their condemnation has grown so heated that this month, Bishop Daniel Jenky, of Peoria, Ill., said in a homily that President Obama was so intolerant of religion that he was “following a similar path” as Hitler and Stalin.The budget authored by Mr. Ryan, a rising star among conservatives, has given Catholic leaders an opportunity to distance the church from the Republican Party.“The preferential option for the poor, which is one of the primary tenants of Catholic social teaching, means don’t keep people poor, don’t make people dependent on government so that they stay stuck at their station in life, help people get out of poverty out onto life of independence,” he said.The letter released Tuesday by the faculty at Georgetown took Mr. Ryan to task for that argument, saying that Catholic teaching calls for government to step in and help when communities “face problems beyond their means to address, such as economic crises, high unemployment, endemic poverty and hunger.”The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has also issued several letters to members of Congress calling for a budget that prioritizes aid to the poor.",center
"GOP Rep. Paul Ryan is heading to Georgetown University for a speech Thursday morning, but not before an old-fashioned, Catholic school knuckle-rapping.A group of nearly 90 professors and administrators connected to the Jesuit-founded school in Washington, D.C., has sent Ryan, R-Wis., a letter saying he’s misused Catholic doctrine to support his deficit-reducing, GOP House budget.“We appreciate your willingness to talk about how Catholic social teaching can help inform effective policy in dealing with the urgent challenges facing our country,” the letter states.Ryan, since introducing the budget last month, has talked about the doctrine in several interviews including one a couple weeks ago on the Christian Broadcasting Network.In that interview, he invoked the Catholic teaching of ""subsidiarity,"" saying it means ""not having big government crowd out civic society, but ... having enough space in our communities so that we can interact with each other"" and take care of people.""To me, the principle of subsidiarity, which is really federalism, meaning government closest to the people governs best,"" he said.The Georgetown University letter argues, though, that Ryan misappropriated the Catholic teaching as a “rationale for gutting government programs.”The writers acknowledge that the teaching indeed calls for local-level solutions to problems but say it is “not a free pass to dismantle government” and requires higher levels of government.The statement also quotes from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' letters to Congress saying budgets cannot rely on disproportionate cuts in essential services to the poor.Ryan, a Catholic and chairman of the House Budget Committee, said last week the letters do not express the views of all U.S. bishops, a point on which the conference disagrees.Georgetown's Public Policy Institute, which is hosting the upcoming Ryan lecture, said Wednesday the event is still scheduled for Thursday morning.""Chairman Ryan remains grateful for Georgetown's invitation to advance a thoughtful dialogue this week on his efforts to avert a looming debt crisis that would hurt the poor the first and the worst,” a Ryan spokesman said.Ryan, who was raised on Social Security benefits after his father died, also on Fox News defended his budget against the conference, saying for instance that the concept of denying tax credits to illegal immigrants is merely ""following through on policy"" that has had bipartisan support.",right

"WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) met for nearly an hour on Thursday evening in their latest attempt to break the impasse on impending tax hikes and spending cuts.Shortly after the meeting ended, both camps put out identical, banal statements.""The President and Speaker had a frank meeting in the Oval Office tonight,"" said the statements.Boehner was back at the Capitol soon afterward, but said nothing new as he passed reporters eager for a readout.A handful of others attended the meeting.Thursday night’s meeting marks the second time in a week the president and House speaker have met in person, and comes after at least two phone calls in recent days.The continued dialogue provides some rays of hope to a negotiating process that, in recent days, has shown very little progress.With the year-end deadline for all rates to expire and $1 trillion in spending cuts to kick in, the prospect of actually failing to find agreement is coming into focus.Boehner, meanwhile, told lawmakers earlier Thursday not to make plans for Christmas, signaling that there may not realistically be a final deal until the very end of the month.“I can’t speculate about the time frame,” Carney said at his daily briefing.",left
"WASHINGTON -- In the wake of Mitt Romney's choice of Paul Ryan as his vice presidential nominee, the politics of Medicare have become almost as complicated as the policy itself.The most recent back-and-forth between the Romney and Obama campaigns concerns which candidate would do more harm to people's benefits.""He stole $700 billion from Medicare to fund Obamacare,"" said RNC Chair Reince Priebus.That rejoinder is now a subject of intense debate.The savings come predominantly from limiting waste, fraud and abuse, mostly in Medicare Advantage, and are budgeted to help subsidize insurance for people under the ACA.Part of the reason that the Obama campaign is crying foul over this line of criticism, however, may be because it knows how effective it can be.""How would your golden years turn out under John McCain?Obama made the same argument on the stump.""It turns out, Senator McCain would pay for part of his plan by making drastic cuts in Medicare: $882 billion worth -- $882 billion in Medicare cuts to pay for a ill-conceived, badly thought-through health care plan that won't provide more health care to people, even though Medicare is already facing a looming shortfall,"" Obama declared at a campaign stop in Roanoke, Va.Douglas Holtz-Eakin, McCain's policy director at the time, recalled that the attack originated with a Wall Street Journal article that referenced his saying that McCain would assume savings in Medicare and Medicaid spending to make his health care plan budget neutral.FactCheck.org rated the Obama ad as ""false,"" noting that the McCain campaign wasn't talking about slashing benefits but limiting waste and slowing the rate of growth.This was a relatively minor aspect of the Obama campaign's assault on McCain's Medicare record.""Like Governor Romney has refused to specify how he will pay for his $5 trillion tax cuts weighted toward millionaires, Senator McCain would have cut $1.3 trillion from health care programs to pay for tax cuts while refusing to rule out cutting benefits or to say what he was cutting,"" Obama's current campaign press secretary, Ben LaBolt, said in an email to The Huffington Post.But the attack on McCain's accounting was part of the assault nonetheless.",right
"Like many conservative Republicans, Mitt Romney is opposed not only to same-sex marriage, but also to the civil unions that many states have adopted as an alternative to full marital rights for gay couples.Now that President Obama, long a supporter of civil unions, has publicly embraced same-sex marriage, the question of precisely what legal status and protections should be granted to gay couples is emerging as an issue of the starkest possible contrast between the two presidential candidates.In short, both Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama have adopted the favored position of their ideological base on a subject that profoundly animates both of those camps.On Wednesday, in anticipation of Mr. Obama’s announcement, Mr. Romney laid out his belief that marriage — and anything resembling it — should be restricted to heterosexual couples, even as he acknowledged that it was “a very tender and sensitive topic.”In doing so, he left open many questions about what his vision of legally recognizable gay unions would encompass, and what it would exclude.“My view is the same as it’s been from the beginning,” Mr. Romney told a CBS affiliate in Denver.“If a civil union is identical to marriage other than with the name, why, I don’t support that,” he said Wednesday.Nine states, including California, Delaware and New Jersey, now allow civil unions and broad domestic partnerships that most likely fit Mr. Romney’s description of marriage-like arrangements, meaning that they would be in the cross hairs of a President Romney, who supports a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage.Those states offer an array of different rights to same-sex couples, among them the ability to pool resources for tax purposes, place a spouse on an employee health care plan and inherit property after a death.Mr. Romney has said that he favors allowing domestic partnerships that bestow certain rights on same-sex couples, like hospital visitation, but he has not delineated them in great detail.“Benefits of that nature may well be appropriate, and states are able to make a provision for the determination of those kinds of rights,” Mr. Romney said Wednesday.Republicans and Democrats, in their reactions to the president’s support for same-sex marriage, said they saw a newly wide, and seemingly unbridgeable, gap between the two leaders on the issue.“We now have a clear choice between Romney and Obama,” said Maggie Gallagher, a founder of the National Organization for Marriage, which opposes same-sex marriage.Evan Wolfson, the founder of Freedom to Marry, a gay rights organization, said that now “there is absolutely no way that opponents of gay rights can hide behind any unclarity in the president’s position and make the bogus claim that it’s the same as theirs.”Mr. Romney has, over the years, made it clear that his opposition to same-sex marriage and civil unions is a deeply held moral conviction, and he has not shied from using strong language to describe the offense he has taken to its introduction.When in 2003 the Massachusetts courts legalized same-sex marriage in the state, Mr. Romney, then governor, complained that the state had become “San Francisco East.”Democrats contend that, like Mr. Obama’s views, Mr. Romney’s feelings about gay rights have evolved, but in the opposite direction: During his campaign for the Senate in 1994, Mr. Romney vowed to seek “full equality” for gays and lesbians, in a letter to the Log Cabin Republicans of Massachusetts.In that letter he argued that he was more supportive of gay rights than his Democratic opponent at the time, Senator Edward M. Kennedy.But at the time, same-sex marriage was a little-discussed item on the agenda of national gay rights leaders, and aides say Mr. Romney has consistently opposed both marriage and civil unions that resemble marriage for gay couples.",right
"Updated: Rick Santorum on Sunday tried to clarify his comment that President Obama subscribed to a “phony theology,” saying he was referring not to the president’s faith but to his view of man’s relationship to the world.It was during a campaign stop in Ohio on Saturday that Mr. Santorum described what he called the “phony theology” of Mr. Obama’s agenda.“It’s about some phony ideal, some phony theology.On Sunday, Robert Gibbs, a political adviser to President Obama, criticized such attacks on “character and faith.”“I can’t help but think that those remarks are well over the line.Mr. Santorum, at another appearance on Saturday, in Columbus, Ohio, called the idea of schools being run by the federal government or by state governments “anachronistic.”“Where did they come up that public education and bigger education bureaucracies was the rule in America?” he said.“Yes the government can help,” Mr. Santorum added.Asked about those remarks on the CBS News program “Face the Nation,” Mr. Santorum, who with his wife has home-schooled their children, remained adamant on Sunday.While he said he did not oppose government financing of schools, Mr. Santorum said that “public education should be a dynamic process that’s locally run.”“I think the parent should be in charge,” he added, “working with the local school district to try to design an educational environment for each child that optimizes their potential.”Mr. Santorum also defended his criticism of a requirement in the president’s health-care policy that insurance companies to cover prenatal testing.The former Pennsylvania senator has a 3-year-old daughter, Bella, with a serious chromosomal disorder, and he said that doctors who detect such a condition before birth typically recommend abortion.Asked whether he was suggesting that Mr. Obama lacked sympathy for the disabled, Mr. Santorum did not back down, saying, “I think the president has a very bad record on the issue of abortion and children who are disabled.”One of Mr. Santorum’s rivals for the Republican nomination, Representative Ron Paul of Texas, scoffed at Mr. Santorum on Sunday for focusing on social issues like abortion and contraception – and for believing that he could defeat Mr. Obama.“Well, I don’t see how that’s possible,” Mr. Paul said on the CNN program “State of the Union.”“And this whole idea about talking about the social issues and who is going to pay for birth control pills,” Mr. Paul said.",center
"HOUSTON — The decision by Republican convention delegates to oppose abortion without explicit exceptions for rape and incest poses a tricky political challenge for Mitt Romney as he prepares to accept the presidential nomination in Tampa, Fla., next week.The vote puts the Republican Party at odds with Mr. Romney, who supports rape and incest exceptions, at a time that controversial comments by Representative Todd Akin, the Republican Senate candidate in Missouri, have increased national scrutiny on the divisive social issue.Mr. Akin said over the weekend that women’s bodies will resist getting pregnant from a “legitimate rape,” comments that have been widely condemned, including by Mr. Romney who called for Mr. Akin to withdraw from the race.“Today, his fellow Missourians urged him to step aside, and I think he should accept their counsel and exit the Senate race,” Mr. Romney said in a statement, citing former Missouri senators like John Ashcroft, Kit Bond, John Danforth and Jim Talent.But Mr. Akin on Tuesday refused to step down from his race despite loud calls from his party’s leaders to abandon his bid.Aides to Mr. Romney declined to say on Tuesday whether he would call on the convention delegates to reconsider their position on abortion.Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, tried to deflect questions on behalf of Mr. Romney, saying on Fox News that “this is the platform of the Republican Party, it is not the platform of Mitt Romney.”The reluctance to talk about the platform reflects the delicate position that Mr. Romney is in when it comes to abortion policy.A supporter of abortion rights early in his political career, Mr. Romney later switched his position.But as he prepares to accept that nomination next week in Tampa, Mr. Romney is once again being forced to carefully navigate between the uncompromising antiabortion positions of his party’s base and the more moderate politics of the swing voters he needs to win over.The vote on the platform is an important part of the Republican Party’s outreach to its conservative base.The party platform — and the positions taken on abortion, same-sex marriage and other social issues — are a key part of that effort.If Mr. Romney were to reject the party’s tough abortion plank, it would send a politically difficult message to conservatives about how Mr. Romney might govern once he got into the White House.There could also be a flurry of conservative outrage at the convention, which could distract from the carefully choreographed event Mr. Romney’s strategists are planning.But Mr. Romney’s campaign is also trying hard to make sure that the convention projects an image that swing voters in battleground states will find appealing.The campaign has already chosen in the last several weeks to move off its core message about jobs and the economy.In the current political environment involving Mr. Akin’s comments, a decision by Mr. Romney to accept the party’s abortion plank will open his campaign to attacks from his rivals that he is out of step with moderate, independent voters.Democrats have already pounced.“American women know that Mitt Romney, Paul Ryan and the party they lead are the wrong choice for women and their families,” a statement from the Democratic committee said.",center
"Even though Bibi Netanyahu recently decried the use of his name in election-year politicking, the Israeli prime minister is the subject of a new ad by Secure America Now, a neoconservative nonprofit organization dedicated to influencing the debate around American security and foreign policy.Politico reports:“A Republican involved with the project said it’s airing in Miami, West Palm Beach and Ft.

Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney has repeatedly targeted the Obama administration for not taking a firm enough stance against Iran, claiming on many occasions that the president has “thrown Israel under a bus.”But Netanyahu pushed back against these criticisms in two separate interviews on Sunday, first telling CNN, “I know that people are trying to draw me into the American election.He also rejected reports that Obama refused his request for a meeting, pinning the circumstances on a scheduling conflict, as has the White House when pressed on the subject.“President Obama has said that he’s determined to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons and I appreciate that and I respect that,” Netanyahu said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”When asked if Obama had thrown Israel under a bus, Netanyahu responded, “There is no bus.”This isn’t the first ad Secure America Now has run against Obama, even though on its website the organization describes itself as representing all political ideologies.The Obama administration is not mentioned by name in the latest spot, but it implicitly underscores the GOP’s narrative on the president’s relationship with the country’s closest ally.",left
"Paul Ryan went on offense Tuesday in response to criticism over his Medicare plan, using an interview with Fox News coupled with a new TV ad to claim President Obama’s health care plan treats the treasured entitlement like a “piggy bank,” while the “Romney-Ryan” plan preserves it.Ryan, in his first one-on-one interview since being named Saturday as Mitt Romney’s running mate, told Fox News on Tuesday he thinks Medicare can be a winning issue for their campaign.""We're the ones who are offering a plan to save Medicare, to protect Medicare, to strengthen Medicare,"" Ryan said.He added: “President Obama is actually damaging Medicare for current seniors.The comments signal Ryan and Romney are prepared to dig in and fight back, as Democrats lob charges that Ryan stands for “ending Medicare as we know it.”The Obama campaign used that line Monday in a Web video timed for Romney’s arrival in Florida, with its large senior population.The Romney campaign retorted with an ad of its own Tuesday.Ryan told Fox News the campaign is trying to show the “clear contrast” between what Republicans propose and what Obama’s health care law does.“They turned Medicare into a piggy bank to finance ObamaCare,” Ryan said.The Obama campaign is disputing that argument.“The savings his ad attacks do not cut a single guaranteed Medicare benefit, and Mitt Romney embraced the very same savings when he promised he’d sign Paul Ryan’s budget,” Smith said.Both sides are being selective in how they describe each other’s plans.The Ryan proposal, submitted again in the House earlier this year, would a decade from now give seniors government payments to purchase private plans or stay within the current system.But while Ryan slams the health care overhaul for cutting Medicare, even he acknowledged that his own plan achieves “savings” for Medicare in the long run.And the ObamaCare cuts he referenced would likely come in the form of lower payments to providers.In his interview with Fox News, Ryan also hammered Obama for what he called his “utter failure when it comes to creating jobs.”Ryan offered new insight as well on how Romney and Ryan came to bond in the months before he was announced as running mate.He recalled when he was campaigning with Romney earlier this year ahead of the Wisconsin primary.“We spent about five days on the road, five working hour or so days,” he said.Ryan said he doesn’t know whether he had a “special place” but it was “very clear we thought the same on these issues.”“When he asked me to join the ticket, he basically said to me, 'You share my values and you have the kind of experience that could be a complement to my experience to getting this country back on track, to creating jobs, to getting people back to work, to saving this country from a debt crisis,'"" Ryan said.Ryan also discussed his affection for novelist Ayn Rand, saying “Atlas Shrugged” triggered his interest in economics.Obama, meanwhile, took on Ryan for the second straight day Tuesday, using a stop in Oskaloosa, Iowa, to criticize Ryan’s and Romney’s tax plan.“You may have heard that Governor Romney just chose his running mate, Congressman Ryan.",left
"President Obama was heading to Detroit Monday afternoon to continue campaigning for tax hikes on top earners -- a day after a face-to-face meeting with House Speaker John Boehner that offered slight hope the two could be making progress toward a deal.The president and the speaker met Sunday afternoon at the White House for the first time in weeks.Both sides were tightlipped about the surprise Sunday afternoon meeting.""This afternoon, the President and Speaker Boehner met at the White House to discuss efforts to resolve the fiscal cliff.Lawmakers and the White House have three weeks to reach a deal, before a potentially crippling set of tax hikes and spending cuts takes effect.Boehner last week put a counter-proposal on the table that included $800 billion in revenue increases over the next decade.Boehner, though, is facing some pressure from Republicans to give a little bit more.The speaker is effectively caught between two competing wings of the Republican Party.Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., became the latest Republican to open the door to tax rate hikes during an interview on ""Fox News Sunday.""""There is a growing group of folks that are looking at this and realizing that we don't have a lot of cards as it relates to the tax issue, before year-end.Corker suggested that Republicans instead focus on extracting entitlement cuts as part of the debt-ceiling negotiations.""Republicans know that they have the debt ceiling that's coming up right around the corner, and the leverage is going to shift, as soon as we get beyond this issue,"" Corker said on ""Fox News Sunday.""Corker said that if the president wants to raise the debt limit by $2 trillion, Republicans should press for $2 trillion in spending cuts.That prospect is sure to infuriate the White House.The president argues that fights over the debt ceiling merely shake global confidence in the country's ability to pay its bills, and as part of talks over the looming fiscal crisis has called for a de facto permanent increase in the debt limit.It's unclear whether Obama might drop that demand if he gets what he wants on tax rates.His campaign-style visit to Detroit, though, threatens to muddy the waters on talks.Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., the No. 3 Republican in the House, suggested Sunday that the president's itinerary has left Republicans to negotiate with themselves.""He's been to Pennsylvania.

"A more congenial Rick Santorum doubled down on several controversial, and religiously laden, remarks in an interview Sunday morning on CBS's ""Face the Nation,"" where he defended his recent claims that prenatal testing results in abortions, that federally provided education was ""anachronistic,"" and that President Obama's policies are not ""based on the Bible.""""I've repeatedly said I don't question the president's faith,"" Santorum told host Bob Schieffer, denying what some have said was a signal that Santorum had challenged the legitimacy of Obama's Christianity.In a speech to Tea Party conservatives on Saturday in Columbus, Ohio, Santorum had dismissed Obama’s politics as being based in “some phony theology.”""It's not about you. It's not about your quality of life. It's not about your jobs,"" Santorum said.An incredulous Bob Schieffer began his interview with Santorum Sunday by asking, ""What in the world were you talking about?""""I was talking about the radical environmentalists,"" Santorum said, suggesting that they believe man should protect the earth, rather than ""steward its resources.""Earlier in the day on Saturday, Santorum had also said that health insurance plans shouldn’t be required to cover prenatal testing, because that testing results in more abortions, as well as contending that government-run public education was “anachronistic.”""Free prenatal testing ends up in more abortions and therefore less care that has to be done, because we cull the ranks of the disabled in our society,"" Santorum told the Ohio Christian Alliance conference.Asked by Schieffer about his claims that prenatal testing leads to more abortions, Santorum insisted that this was ""a fact.""""We're talking about specifically prenatal testing, and specifically amniocentesis, which is a procedure that actually creates a risk of having a miscarriage when you have it, and is done for the purposes of identifying maladies of a child in the womb.Santorum had said that because of this trend, health insurance providers should not be forced to make the procedures available free of charge.Santorum also told Schieffer that government-provided education was not working and that the process ought to be customizable, like buying a car.""I'm saying that local communities and parents should be the ones in control over public education, certainly not the federal government, and I think the state governments have not done a particularly good job in public education, either,"" Santorum said.Buying a car, by contrast he said, is ""designed to meet the needs of a customer.Speaking earlier on ABC's ""This Week"" about Santorum's remarks, Obama campaign aide Robert Gibbs called his rhetoric ""well over the line.""""I think it's time in our politics that we get rid of this mindset that if we disagree, we have to disqualify each other,"" Gibbs said.""I think if you make comments like that, you make comments that are well over the line,"" he added.",left

"WASHINGTON — With just three weeks left for lawmakers to avert a fiscal crisis, President Obama and Speaker John A. Boehner met privately at the White House on Sunday as a top Republican senator suggested that his party should perhaps accede to Mr. Obama’s demand to raise the top tax rates so that the attention can shift to making serious cuts in benefit programs like Medicare and Medicaid.Administration officials would not offer details of the discussion between Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner.The White House and Mr. Boehner’s office issued identical statements afterward that said “the lines of communication remain open.”The meeting was the first face-to-face negotiation between the president and the speaker since a session three weeks ago, when they were joined by the House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi of California; the Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid of Nevada; and the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.The latest meeting gave rise to renewed optimism that a deal could be reached before the end of the month.“My guess is still that we will reach a deal, but I do not think that anything is either certain or imminent,” Representative Tom Cole, an Oklahoma Republican and Boehner lieutenant, said Sunday night.Any optimism is a step forward from Friday, when Mr. Boehner told reporters that he did not have a progress report because there was “no progress to report.”But the ups and downs of the search for a deal to avert a fiscal crisis have been in large measure for public consumption.Just hours before the White House meeting, Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, said on “Fox News Sunday” that a small but growing group of Republicans had begun considering acquiescing on tax rates so that the negotiations could shift to entitlement programs.Mr. Corker, a member of the Banking Committee who had presented a deficit-reduction plan of his own, said that if Republicans gave in to the president’s chief demand, then “all of a sudden the shift goes back to entitlements, and maybe it puts us in a place where we actually can do something that really saves the nation.”Republicans have been insisting that the Obama administration agree to substantial savings in entitlement programs as the two sides negotiate how to narrow the country’s huge deficits.That group of Republicans, Mr. Corker said on Fox, was beginning to realize “that we don’t have a lot of cards as it relates to the tax issue before year end” — but that a tax-rate concession could be converted, jujitsu style, into a tactical advantage.Mr. Corker’s comments came as central figures on network news programs mixed cautious words of optimism over the negotiations between the White House and Congressional Republicans with dire warnings about what a failure to act might bring.Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, warned that such a failure was the gravest threat now facing the still-fragile United States economy — greater than the European debt crisis or any uncertainty in China.“It would result in the stock market really taking a hit,” Ms. Lagarde said on the CNN program “State of the Union.”She called for a “balanced” agreement of both revenue increases and spending cuts.",right
"WASHINGTON - Representative Paul D. Ryan’s budget blueprint assumes the same amount of Medicare savings as President Obama’s health care law, even though Mitt Romney and Mr. Ryan have said those cuts would be devastating to millions of older Americans on MedicareAs the partisan brawl over Medicare continued on Tuesday and threatened to become the focus of the race, the Obama campaign said that Mr. Ryan’s budget plan — broadly endorsed by Mr. Romney — “would end Medicare as we know it” and shift costs to beneficiaries.The Republicans hit back on Tuesday with a television commercial asserting that the Romney-Ryan Medicare plan was better for older Americans.“You paid into Medicare for years, every paycheck,” the advertisement says.Lis Smith, a spokeswoman for the Obama campaign, said, “Mitt Romney’s Medicare ad is dishonest and hypocritical.”In an interview with Fox News on Tuesday, Mr. Ryan said he welcomed the back and forth.“This is a debate we want to have,” he said.With 50 million beneficiaries, Medicare is a major concern for both parties.Mr. Obama would use the savings to help offset the cost of covering the uninsured, as well as to improve the financial condition of the Medicare trust fund.Republicans won control of the House in 2010 partly by arguing that Democrats had raided Medicare to pay for Mr. Obama’s health care law.Those savings have a complicated history.Mr. Ryan’s budget plan was approved in March by the House Budget Committee, of which he is chairman.Representative Allyson Y. Schwartz, Democrat of Pennsylvania, asked whether the savings in the Affordable Care Act — “sometimes referred to as cuts to Medicare” — were part of Mr. Ryan’s budget.Austin Smythe, the panel’s Republican staff director, said: “We assume those savings.At another point, Mr. Smythe said, “We assume the repeal of all of the expansions in the Affordable Care Act.”Those expansions, he said, include subsidies to help low- and middle-income people buy private insurance.The House approved the Ryan budget plan on March 29 by a vote of 228 to 191, with all but 10 Republicans voting for it.Mr. Romney has offered a Medicare proposal similar to Mr. Ryan’s.“Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan have always been fully committed to repealing Obamacare, ending President Obama’s $716 billion raid on Medicare, and tackling the serious fiscal challenges our country faces,” said Lanhee Chen, the policy director for the Romney campaign.The Ryan plan, like any budget resolution, specifies levels of spending, savings and revenues, based on certain policy assumptions.Mr. Ryan and Mr. Obama would impose similar overall constraints on Medicare spending, stipulating that average spending per beneficiary should not grow faster than the economy, measured by the per capita output of goods and services, plus one-half of one percentage point.However, they would achieve the goal in different ways.Mr. Ryan and Mr. Romney would limit the government’s current open-ended financial commitment to Medicare.The new health care law, by contrast, will reduce projected Medicare payments to health maintenance organizations, hospitals and many other health care providers.Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan would abolish the panel, which they describe as a tool for rationing health care.",center
"Speaker John A.

"Hundreds of thousands of people across the country headed to Chick-fil-A restaurants on Wednesday, answering a call from Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, to show support for the fast-food chain after the company’s president drew criticism for his opposition to same-sex marriage.Long lines were seen outside Chick-fil-A restaurants nationwide, and many customers documented their visits on social media sites and shared their reasons for eating at the chain.Many said they showed up because they agreed with the position of Chick-fil-A’s president on same-sex marriage, while others said they wanted to support freedom of expression for business owners.As my colleagues Kim Severson and Robbie Brown report from Atlanta, where Chick-fil-A began in the 1940s, the president, Dan T. Cathy, made comments last month about the biblical arguments against homosexuality.Last weekend, Mr. Huckabee used his television and radio programs, as well as Facebook, to help organize an appreciation day for Chick-fil-A on Wednesday.More than 650,000 people signed up to participate, and tens of thousands “liked” photos of packed restaurants that Mr. Huckabee posted on his Facebook page on Wednesday.Below are some of the photos shared Wednesday on Twitter from Chick-fil-A restaurants around the country.Representative Michele Bachmann, Republican of Minnesota, shared a photo from her visit.Last week, Sarah Palin posted a photo of her visit to a Chick-fil-A in California on her Facebook page.Mr. Huckabee noted in regular audio updates Wednesday that Chick-fil-A did not participate in organizing the event.In response to the outpouring of support for Chick-fil-A, many people used social media to share their disappointment.One Facebook user who lives near Austin, Tex., posted this status update:“It has been really disconcerting how many of my FB friends have stood up on the side of hate and proudly posted their photos of Chick-fil-a — and they all have their little quotes about how they ‘love their gay friends’ but they ‘don’t approve’ of their lifestyles.So I am asking you kindly to please un-friend me — I have no use for friends like you.”The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation has asked supporters to donate the cost of a meal at a Chick-fil-A, about $6.50, to gay and lesbian rights groups.Facebook users are also signing up to participate in a “National Same-Sex Kiss Day” planned for Friday at Chick-fil-A restaurants.Others are not waiting until Friday to post their photos.",center

Reese , one of the organizers of the letter.The letter quotes the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, which wrote several letters to Congress saying “a just framework for future budgets cannot rely on disproportionate cuts in essential services to poor persons.”“I am afraid that Chairman Ryan’s budget reflects the values of his favorite philosopher Ayn Rand rather than the gospel of Jesus Christ,” said Father Reese.The Georgetown scholars pointed to the devastating impact of cuts in food programs that keep the poor from starvation.The scholars corrected Mr. Ryan on his use of the Catholic concept of “subsidiarity” as “a rationale gutting government programs.”The scholars also gave the Representative a reading assignment: “The Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church,” which was commissioned by John Paul II and published by the Vatican.Signing the letter were over a dozen Georgetown Jesuit priests, numerous members of the Theology and other departments including History, Government, Philosophy, School of Foreign Service and School of Nursing & Health Studies.",center

"DANVILLE, Ky. –- Joe Biden did everything President Barack Obama did not last week, and a good bit more.The vice president dominated the spotlight in the only debate between himself and Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), charging at Republican Mitt Romney's running mate from the get-go and bombarding him with a flurry of eye rolls, interjections and accusations.What it accomplished among undecided voters, if anything, is hard to tell and will take days to sort out.Obama, at least, was cheered by the offensive.""I'm going to make a special point of saying that I thought Joe Biden was terrific tonight,"" the president told reporters after stepping off Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, on his way back to the White House after a day of campaigning in Florida.Biden looked as if he could barely stay in his seat for much of the night, interrupting Ryan repeatedly and sometimes making it difficult for the GOP nominee to get out his answers.“He had his Red Bull. He certainly had his caffeine,” Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) said after the debate.It was a performance by the vice president guaranteed to amp up -– and buck up -– worried Democrats, who had fallen into a paralysis of anxiety after the president's debate.Obama adviser David Axelrod said ""Andrew is a unique thinker, and I can't speak for how he might react to this.Sullivan, for the record, called the night ""a solid win for Biden"" and called Ryan ""competent.""The Obama campaign team, in the spin room after the debate, focused on repeating the theme that, as Axelrod said, Biden showed ""passion"" and that he showed ""a great concern for the middle class.""By contrast, Romney operatives in the spin room said Ryan clearly won on substance and composure while Biden devolved into fits of laughter and audible groans.“I think the way the vice president handled himself was condescending,” said Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah).Democrats were intent Thursday night to steal back any edge Romney might have deprived them of in being the party who can appeal to working class and blue-collar voters, and to any voter who considers themselves middle class, which is a large number.""These guys discovered the phrase 'middle class' during the last six months on the campaign trail,"" said Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), who has sparred with Ryan on the House Budget Committee for years and who played Ryan in debate preparation with Biden.Though it was Biden at the center of attention and who made it hard for Ryan to get in a word edgewise at times, the 42-year-old kept his composure for much of the night and got in some well-aimed shots at the vice president, who at 69 is his senior by 27 years.The night's 90-minute debate, the only one for the two vice presidential candidates, fluctuated between domestic policy and foreign policy, with ABC's Martha Raddatz, a reporter with vast foreign policy experience, asking numerous questions about events overseas.But the number one goal for Biden all night was obvious from the outset: push back. Hard.After Ryan finished his opening statement, responding to a question about the death of the U.S. ambassador to Libya in a terrorist attack in Benghazi a month ago, Biden responded: ""That's a bunch of malarkey.""""Not a single thing he said is accurate,"" Biden said.At times, Biden repeatedly butted in on Ryan's answers, refusing to let Ryan finish his thought.Republicans thought it was much more than that.Romney adviser Eric Fehrnstrom tweeted: “Ryan: serious, sober, steady.Some of the more experienced Republicans tried to resist talking about Biden’s behavior, knowing it would come across as complaining.“Most people probably found the vice president’s performance a little -- well anyway, I think that people will judge for themselves,” said Ed Gillespie, one of the top advisers to Romney and one of the most seasoned Republican operatives in politics.But not even Gillespie, when he was asked by a reporter where he was going before he cut himself off, could resist getting some digs at Biden.“I don't know if his staff didn't brief him or not, but somebody should have told him that these debates are split-screen,” Gillespie said.“There seemed to be some frustration on his part at times, and sometimes I got the impression that he couldn't defend the facts as they were, [so] raise your voice a little louder,” Gillespie said.The Obama campaign, of course, relished in Republicans’ focus on Biden’s behavior instead of the substance of his remarks.""Their side is all spending their time talking about laughing and facial tics,"" said Obama campaign manager Jim Messina.Of course, Biden was so demonstrative, so outsized, that it was hard to talk about anything else.Biden did another thing Obama did not a week ago.One of Ryan’s best one-liners came when he sought to explain these comments.Ryan first told a humanizing story about Romney caring for a family whose children were in a car crash, a story clearly prepared to push back against the portrait of Romney as out of touch and uncaring.Although there were extended portions of the debate that focused on Libya, Syria, and Afghanistan, Biden and Ryan did engage in a lengthy back-and-forth in the middle of the debate on Medicare and tax policy.Ryan was, as usual, knowledgeable and in command of the facts.“Stop talking about how you care about people.Ryan smiled, and continued to work through a data-filled argument, mentioning the $831 billion stimulus, an 8 percent unemployment rate for 43 months, the 1.3 percent growth rate of the economy, the $90 billion for green energy programs in the stimulus, and the 12 million jobs he and Romney say their economic program would create.Biden didn’t worry so much about numbers.The $6,400 figure is based on a study of one of Ryan’s earlier plans for Medicare, which he has since changed to make it more bipartisan.Biden, aware of this, told voters they should be suspicious somebody “who would actually put in motion a plan that … added $6,400 a year more to the cost of Medicare?”",liberal

"President Trump on Monday called the criminal case against former national security adviser Michael Flynn “very unfair,” claiming he and Hillary Clinton both “lied” to the FBI but only Flynn faced consequences.The president’s comments, made to reporters as he left Washington for a policy announcement in Utah, saw Trump wading deeper into the Flynn investigation even after a weekend tweet landed the White House in hot water.On Monday, Trump said he feels “badly” for Flynn, who pleaded guilty on Friday to giving false statements to the FBI about his Russia contacts.“Hillary Clinton lied many times to the FBI, nothing happened to her. Flynn lied and they destroyed his life,” Trump said. The president, without offering specifics, said his 2016 Democratic rival “lied many times” during her FBI interview in early July.“Nothing happened to her. Flynn lied and it’s like they ruined his life. Very unfair,” Trump said, echoing a weekend tweet in which he asked whether a “double standard” was at play.Clinton was interviewed by FBI agents as part of the investigation into her exclusive use of a private email system while secretary of state. After that interview, then-FBI Director James Comey called her actions extremely careless without recommending criminal charges.Trump also noted over the weekend that Clinton was not recorded or under oath during that interview.On Sunday, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., suggested Trump might want to think twice before tweeting and commenting on the Russia case. “You tweet and comment regarding ongoing criminal investigations at your own peril,” he said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”This was after Trump’s account tweeted Saturday: “I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies. It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!”That tweet immediately caused problems for the White House, as some legal experts said it potentially exposed the president to obstruction of justice allegations – since, according to the tweet, he would have known Flynn lied to agents when he allegedly asked Comey to lay off the Flynn investigation and later fired Comey. Trump said earlier this year that he fired Flynn only for lying to Vice President Pence about the issue.Trump’s personal lawyer John Dowd later said he was the one who wrote that tweet, saying he “did not mean to break news.”Dowd attempted to explain Sunday that the tweet was referring to then-acting Attorney General Sally Yates telling White House Counsel Don McGahn in January that Flynn had “given the agents the same story he gave the vice president.”He also said the agents seemed to think Flynn was confused. “All the president knew was that the department was not accusing him of lying,” Dowd said.Trump over the weekend denied that he asked Comey to stop investigating Flynn.Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday that the panel has begun to see ""the putting together of a case of obstruction of justice"" against Trump.Flynn is now cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigators in the Russia meddling case, though it’s unclear what exactly he might reveal about Trump and his associates.",liberal
"The leaders of the Senate intelligence committee said Tuesday they had subpoenaed two of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn's businesses as part of the ongoing probe into Russian activity during last year's presidential campaign.Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., the top Democrat on the committee, identified the businesses as Flynn Intel Group LLC and Flynn Intel Group Inc., both based in Alexandria, Va.The committee's action comes a day after Flynn’s lawyer notified the committee that his client will invoke his Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination and not comply with the committee’s subpoena seeking documents related to its investigation.""A business does not have the right to take the fifth,"" Warner told reporters.The investigation focuses on whether Flynn and other Trump associates colluded with Russia to boost the Republican candidate in the 2016 elections.Trump fired Flynn in February because he misled Vice President Mike Pence about conversations he had with Russia’s ambassador about potentially easing economic sanctions.Flynn is also being investigated over whether he was fully forthcoming about his foreign contacts and earnings from organizations linked to the governments of Russia and Turkey.Intelligence committee chairman Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., said Tuesday that the panel also sent a letter to Flynn’s lawyer questioning whether his client can indeed invoke the Fifth Amendment to avoid turning over documents.Burr added that if there is no response from Flynn, the committee may consider pursuing a contempt of Congress charge.""Everything is on the table,"" Burr said.",center
"WASHINGTON — The House Intelligence Committee will issue subpoenas to Michael T. Flynn, President Trump’s first national security adviser, the committee’s senior Democrat said on Wednesday, escalating Mr. Flynn’s troubles with Congress.The Democrat, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, said Mr. Flynn had declined the panel’s request for documents and an interview as part of its investigation into Russian meddling in last year’s election.“Those subpoenas will be designed to maximize our chance of getting the information that we need,” Mr. Schiff told reporters during a breakfast hosted by The Christian Science Monitor.Mr. Schiff said he hoped the committee would issue the subpoenas this week, before Congress leaves for a one-week recess.The subpoenas could not be issued without at least some support from Republicans, who make up the majority of the committee.The announcement was made mere hours after the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee issued subpoenas Tuesday afternoon to Mr. Flynn’s two firms, seeking information that could shed light on his lobbying work on behalf of Turkish interests last year, among other connections.On Monday, Mr. Flynn, in a letter from his legal team, rejected a subpoena for documents from the Senate committee, citing the Fifth Amendment’s protections against self-incrimination.Mr. Flynn’s rejection of the subpoena put him at risk of being held in contempt of Congress, a rarely invoked process that, should lawmakers choose to pursue it, could result in a criminal citation.The Flynn Intel Group was paid more than $500,000 to represent Turkey in a dispute with the United States government while Mr. Flynn was advising the Trump campaign.Mr. Flynn’s legal troubles have only mounted in recent days.Lying to federal officials is a felony, punishable by up to five years in prison.As recently as Monday, in his letter to the Senate committee, Mr. Flynn has reiterated his offer to testify in exchange for immunity from prosecution.",center
"WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump on Monday defended his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, by invoking his 2016 election opponent, Hillary Clinton.“I feel very badly for Gen. Flynn,” Trump told reporters before leaving for a trip to Utah, saying that Flynn’s life has been “ruined.”Trump then pivoted to Clinton, apparently referring to the FBI’s investigation into her use of a private email server.“Hillary Clinton lied many times to the FBI, and nothing happened to her.The president this morning says 'I feel badly for General Flynn.'Flynn pleaded guilty on Friday for lying to the FBI in special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into possible collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia, becoming the first former administration official to face charges in the probe.Trump and the White House have long claimed that the investigations into the campaign have nothing to do with Trump himself.Flynn stepped down in February, saying that he had misled the transition team, including then Vice President-elect Mike Pence, about the extent of his contacts with Russian officials, which included discussing sanctions and the creation of a backchannel with the Kremlin.Trump and his lawyer, John Dowd, now claim that the president already knew about Flynn lying to the FBI, renewing questions of whether Trump obstructed justice in the investigation.In May, Trump told NBC’s Lester Holt that he fired then-FBI Director James Comey with “this Russia thing” in mind.In an interview with Axios published Monday, Dowd brought out a new defense: Trump isn’t guilty of obstructing justice because he is the president.The “President cannot obstruct justice because he is the chief law enforcement officer under [the Constitution’s Article II] and has every right to express his view of any case,” Dowd said.",center
"WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump is “very close” to selecting an interim candidate to replace former FBI Director James Comey, he told White House reporters on Thursday.Trump confirmed that former Sen. Joe Lieberman is his top choice, according to White House pool reports.Trump met on Wednesday with Lieberman and three other candidates: current acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe; Frank Keating, the former governor of Oklahoma who previously served as an FBI agent and in high-level positions in the Justice Department; and Richard McFeely, who served in the FBI for 24 years before retiring as executive assistant director in 2014.Lieberman, who was the 2000 Democratic vice presidential nominee before losing a primary bid for re-election and becoming an independent, would be an unconventional choice.He has previously said that he would support an independent commission to investigate ties between Trump’s administration and Russia.Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) called it a “mistake” to select an elected official to the post, saying that the FBI director should be a law enforcement official.“There is no reason to appoint a politician to run the FBI,” Schatz said.It is rare for an FBI director to be appointed without the full backing of the Senate, Schatz noted.A top Senate Democratic aide, likewise, put the prospects of immense opposition to the pick bluntly in an email to HuffPost: “There couldn’t possibly be worse time to take the unprecedented step of handing the FBI over to a politician.During a Thursday Democratic caucus lunch, Sens. Dick Durbin (Ill.) and Sheldon Whitehouse (R.I.) trashed the idea of Lieberman, or any politician, being in charge of the FBI, according to a senior Democratic aide who was in the private meeting.“The FBI director should be drawn from the ranks of career law enforcement‎, prosecutors or the FBI itself ― not politicians,” Durbin told HuffPost later.Republicans, by contrast, praised Lieberman.“Joe Lieberman has more experience than all of my Democrat colleagues combined, so screw them,” McCain said of Democrats’ concerns.The need for a new FBI director came after Trump fired Comey last week, a stunning move that occurred amid the FBI’s ongoing investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia.",right
"Trump Lashes Out at Kathy Griffin and DemocratsWASHINGTON — President Trump assailed Democrats and a television comedian on Wednesday in his latest Twitter blasts since returning from an overseas trip in which he had largely abstained from the sort of combative social media postings that helped propel him to the Oval Office and have gotten him in trouble ever since.The president castigated Kathy Griffin, the celebrity comic and author, for posing for a video showing her holding what looks like the severed and bloodied head of Mr. Trump.In a statement later in the day, the first lady, Melania Trump, questioned Ms. Griffin’s sanity.The Trumps had the support of the daughter of the woman the president beat in last year’s election, among others.Ms. Griffin went online on Tuesday night to express regret.She said she had asked the photographer to pull the images.CNN, which has enlisted Ms. Griffin to host New Year’s Eve programming alongside Anderson Cooper for the last decade, announced on Wednesday that she would no longer appear.Mr. Cooper distanced himself, as well.Mr. Trump also lashed out at Democrats in Congress whom he accused of trying to squelch testimony involving the investigation into Russian meddling in last year’s election.“So now it is reported that the Democrats, who have excoriated Carter Page about Russia, don’t want him to testify,” he wrote.In a letter to the House Intelligence Committee reported by Fox and other news organizations, Mr. Page wrote: “I have learned from your Committee staff on this Memorial Day holiday that I might not be immediately afforded the opportunity to address the false or misleading testimony by James Comey, John Brennan, et al. as per our previously scheduled appointment for next week.Mr. Page did not list what testimony he considered false by Mr. Comey, who was fired by Mr. Trump as director of the F.B.I., or Mr. Brennan, the former director of the C.I.A., who stepped down when President Barack Obama left office in January.",right
"President Trump thinks Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore “will do the right thing and step aside” if the sexual misconduct allegations against him are true, the White House said in a statement Thursday.Speaking to reporters following the president’s Asia trip on Air Force One, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders also cautioned against a rush to judgment.“Like most Americans, the president believes we cannot allow a mere allegation, in this case one from many years ago, to destroy a person’s life,"" Sanders said.Moore lashed out earlier at what he called ""the Obama-Clinton machine's liberal media lapdogs"" after The Washington Post reported on a woman's claims that the former judge and staunch social conservative initiated a sexual encounter with her when she was 14.In a series of tweets Thursday evening, Moore claimed ""The forces of evil will lie, cheat, steal –– even inflict physical harm –– if they believe it will silence and shut up Christian conservatives.""Amid calls for him to drop out of the race, Moore added, ""Our nation is at a crossroads right now — both spiritually and politically.The Post story centered on allegations made by Leigh Corfman, now 53.During a subsequent visit, Corfman reportedly claimed he took off her shirt and pants; touched her over her bra and underwear; and guided her hand to his underwear.“I wanted it over with – I wanted out,” she told the Post, apparently recalling her train of thought at the time.The report caused immediate problems for Moore with his own party as he heads into the Dec. 12 election against Democrat Doug Jones.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who backed Moore’s rival Luther Strange in the GOP primary, said in a statement: ""If these allegations are true, he must step aside.""Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., head of the Senate GOP campaign arm, called the allegations “deeply troubling” and said: “If these allegations are found to be true, Roy Moore must drop out of the Alabama special Senate election.”Jones’ campaign told multiple news outlets: “Roy Moore needs to answer these serious charges.”But Moore’s campaign issued a statement saying the report is “baseless” and false.“National liberal organizations know their chosen candidate Doug Jones is in a death spiral, and this is their last ditch Hail Mary,” Moore campaign chairman Bill Armistead said.“This garbage is the very definition of fake news and intentional defamation,” he said.The Post noted that the legal age of consent in the state is 16, and sexual contact by anyone 19 or older with anyone between 12 and 16 years old is considered second-degree sexual abuse.The statute of limitations, though, has long since passed.The Post interviewed three other women who were teenagers at the time who claimed Moore pursued them when he was in his 30s, though he did not force them into any type of sexual relationship.“I have prayed over this,” Corfman told the Post as to why she came forward, “All I know is that I can’t sit back and let this continue, let him continue without the mask being removed.”Alabama's Republican governor, Kay Ivey, responded: “These allegations are deeply disturbing.",liberal
"Donald Trump Jr. Communicated With WikiLeaks During CampaignWASHINGTON — Donald Trump Jr. had multiple online conversations during the 2016 presidential campaign with WikiLeaks, the anti-secrecy group that last year released a hacked trove of Democrats’ emails, according to four congressional officials.Mr. Trump, the president’s son, in recent weeks handed over Twitter messages he exchanged with WikiLeaks to several congressional committees investigating Russia’s attempts to disrupt the election, according to the officials.The correspondence, which began weeks before the Nov. 8, 2016, election and continued through much of this year, is the second time it has been publicly revealed that Mr. Trump communicated with people and organizations with ties to the Russian government who were trying to undermine the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton.In July, The New York Times reported that Mr. Trump met with Russians in June 2016 who said they had damaging information on Mrs. Clinton, and that the information was part of the Russian government’s support for Mr. Trump.Mr. Trump on Monday night releasedseveralscreen shots of his messages with WikiLeaks.“We can say with confidence that we have no concerns about these documents and any questions raised about them have been easily answered in the appropriate forum,” Mr. Futerfas said in a statement.By publishing thousands of hacked emails, American intelligence agencies believe WikiLeaks was acting as a conduit for Russian operatives.The Twitter messages were first reported by The Atlantic, which published copies of the correspondence.“Hiya, it’d be great if you guys could comment on/push this story,” WikiLeaks said in a message to Mr. Trump on Oct. 3, 2016, that included a quote from Mrs. Clinton in which she said she wanted to “just drone” Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder.“Already did that earlier today,” Mr. Trump said in response.In a message a week later, WikiLeaks asked Mr. Trump to have his father tweet a link to a site where users could search through hacked emails from Democrats.“There’s many great stories the press are missing and we’re sure some of your follows will find it,” WikiLeaks said, adding that the group had just released more emails stolen from Mrs. Clinton’s campaign chairman, John D. Podesta.Mr. Trump did not respond.Mr. Assange said on Twitter that he could not confirm whether the group had corresponded with Mr. Trump.“WikiLeaks loves its pending publications and ignores those who ask for details,” Mr. Assange said, adding that thousands of people had asked the group about the emails it had published.Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the messages, if real, are “one more example of Russians, Russian agents — in this case WikiLeaks — reaching out to senior officials in the Trump Organization or Trump campaign.”The last message Mr. Trump received from WikiLeaks was in July, shortly after The Times reported that he had corresponded with the Russians promising “dirt” on Mrs. Clinton.“Hi Don.Shortly thereafter, Mr. Trump released the emails himself.",center

"As Senate Democrats float new options for complicating a vote on President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Republicans appear ready to return fire with a bomb of their own – a nuclear one.Top Republican Sen. John Thune, of South Dakota, all but confirmed Wednesday that his party is willing to use what’s known as the “nuclear option,” to lower the vote threshold to confirm Judge Neil Gorsuch if Democrats try to filibuster.“We will do what is necessary to confirm Judge Gorsuch on the Supreme Court, yes,” he told Fox News’ Shannon Bream on “America’s Newsroom,” when asked if they’d go that route.Thune, who serves in the No. 3 position in Senate GOP leadership as chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, added that Democrats “have not laid a glove on him” in the hearings and predicted the judge would get an “affirmative” vote in the Senate.The threat comes as Democrats not only threaten to filibuster but suggest he shouldn’t get a vote until the FBI completes its probe of possible links between Russia and Trump associates.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., both called Tuesday for a postponement on any vote to confirm Gorsuch to the nation’s highest court.“It is unseemly to be moving forward so fast on confirming a Supreme Court justice with a lifetime appointment while this big gray cloud of an FBI investigation hangs over the presidency,” Schumer said.Warren added on Twitter: “Neil Gorsuch is up for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court from a President whose campaign is under FBI investigation.”Republicans panned the call as ""ridiculous.""That's where the so-called ""nuclear option"" comes in.The nuclear option was first used by Democrats for circuit court judicial appointments in 2013 and top Republicans – including President Trump – have indicated for weeks it’s a serious option in order to get Gorsuch on the court.“If we end up with that gridlock, I would say, ‘If you can, Mitch, go nuclear,'” Trump said Feb. 1.Republican Senate leaders so far have refrained from using the term – but their exasperated rhetoric shows they’re at least kicking the tires of a legislative Enola Gay.“If Judge Gorsuch can’t achieve 60 votes in the Senate, could any judge appointed by a Republican president be approved with 60 or more votes in the Senate?” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., asked on Tuesday.McConnell hasn’t tipped his hand on strategy; however, he’s maintained in interviews that, one way or another, “the nominee will be confirmed.”Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., meanwhile, lamented the increasing politicization of Supreme Court nominations and implored his Democratic colleagues to vote on the man – not the party of the president who nominated him.“Here’s what I hope – that we turn around and go back to where we were, because what we’re doing is going to destroy the judiciary over time,” Graham said on Monday.Supreme Court justices have faced more pushback from the opposition party in recent years.",center
"WASHINGTON — The lawmakers trotted from their dugouts at Nationals Park, together in a near-summer air that never quite felt swampy, united in a certainty that the game must go on, just not exactly as it had before.A day earlier, on another ball field some seven miles southwest, a gunman had opened fire on members of the Republican congressional baseball team, striking four people — including Steve Scalise, the majority whip of the House of Representatives — who were there for a practice.And on Thursday, the capital’s various institutional forces — senators and lobbyists, staff members with a job to do and residents with an evening to spare — joined, for a moment, in a bipartisan rebuttal: Play ball.Beneath a mostly cloudless sky, at least by the mid-innings, fans in the stands intermingled red and blue.Near the dugout, the president’s daughter Ivanka Trump bantered with Chuck Schumer, the Senate’s top Democrat, who chatted with two of her young children.When a video message from President Trump played on the big screen, some of the Democrats in the crowd booed, but less lustily than usual.“You are showing the world that we will not be intimidated,” Mr. Trump said.Some members of Congress had not expected to stay behind for the annual showdown, with families and district business waiting for them.But by nightfall, the decision was clear.“We come here, and these members become our family,” Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia, said at the Capitol before a game he had not intended to see.He spoke of 1968 and of the political violence he had seen up close as a civil rights leader, invoking Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy.Mr. Lewis, now 77, stared straight ahead for a moment.All day, before as more than 24,000 ticket holders filed in for the charity game, the shorthand for other tragedies ricocheted through the Capitol.At work on Thursday, those pangs visited lawmakers like a too-familiar houseguest — stalking them down the Capitol’s corridors, past the Senate chamber where a ferocious health care debate had already resumed, along the hall where some had stood one day earlier as survivors, still in dusted cleats and uniforms, unharmed but unsettled.The reaction would be different this time, some said.“What’s the half-life?” asked Senator Roger Wicker, Republican of Mississippi, appraising how long the comity might last.The skepticism is near-universal.In a Thursday morning tweet, Mr. Trump railed against the “WITCH HUNT” of investigations of his associates.Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, said he was warming up with Sean Hannity, the Fox News host, who is not known for bipartisan spirit.And Ms. Pelosi could not resist suggesting that Republicans were the initiators of the present rancor.“Somewhere in the ’90s, Republicans decided on a politics of personal destruction as they went after the Clintons,” she told reporters earlier on Thursday.Moments later, she added, a bit regretfully: “I really am almost sad for myself that I have gone down this path with you, because I don’t think it’s appropriate for us to have the fullest discussion of it.But for an optimist in the city — and there still seem to be a few — there were flourishes to appreciate.House interns hauled signs: “Scalise Strong,” “Capitol Police MVP” and “Unvidvided” in red, white, and blue.Another attendee delivered this message, held aloft: “This Democrat is here to support Congressman Scalise.Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the Democratic whip, resolved to wear a “Team Scalise” shirt to the game.“We don’t dislike each other,” Mr. McConnell said, deploying a rare complimentary double negative.Among those on the field before the game was Representative Roger Williams, Republican of Texas, whose aide Zachary Barth was shot at the practice.David Bailey, a Capitol Police officer who was wounded while helping to stop the attack, threw out the ceremonial first pitch.Mr. Scalise remained in the hospital on Thursday after a second surgery for internal injuries and a broken leg.“Maybe with a little more time, the teams would be mixed,” suggested Representative Ted Deutch, Democrat of Florida.Several elements of the evening did diverge sharply from the ballpark’s standard, professional fare — commonplace for a congressional game that has, since 1909, produced a steady torrent of middling baseball, worse trash talk and more than occasional injury.By the concessions, attendees discussed field director salaries and legislative wrangling.Chants of “We love you, Pelosi!” rang out briefly, until the minority leader acknowledged them.Supporters from both parties raised hot dogs and beers, catching up on acquaintances in common.“We’re just one day removed, so it still feels different, I think,” Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, said before the game, recalling past tragedies that many swore would reshape the nation’s politics.At the practice on Wednesday, Mr. Flake had raced to Mr. Scalise’s side to provide water and first aid after the shooting stopped.He set out a goal for himself and his colleagues, uttered before inside the Capitol.For an evening, at least, Washington delivered.A little before 10 p.m., the Democrats secured their final out for an 11-2 victory, taking a 40-to-39 edge in the lifetime series.Mr. Doyle did not hold the trophy for long.It was going to Mr. Scalise’s office, they decided, until he gets back.",center
"WASHINGTON ―House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) was still in critical condition on Thursday after a lone gunman opened fire Wednesday morning on a group of Republican lawmakers practicing for a congressional baseball game.Six people, including two congressmen, two police officers, a congressional aide and a lobbyist, were injured in the attack in an Alexandria, Virginia, park.Scalise underwent surgery at the MedStar Washington Hospital Center after being shot in the hip.“He underwent immediate surgery and an additional procedure to stop bleeding,” the hospital said, noting the congressman had received multiple blood transfusions and remained in critical condition late Wednesday.Before the surgery, Scalise was “in good spirits and spoke to his wife by phone,” his office said.The Trumps also met with Crystal Griner, one of the two U.S. Capitol Police officers injured in the attack, and her wife.Vice President Mike Pence and second lady Karen Pence also checked in on Scalise and Griner on Thursday.Zachary Barth, a staffer for Rep. Roger Williams (R-Texas), was shot in the leg.Matt Mika, director of government relations for Tyson Foods’ Washington, D.C., office, was also among those shot.The attack took place shortly after 7 a.m. at Eugene Simpson Stadium Park, less than 8 miles south of the White House.The FBI is investigating Hodgkinson and his possible motives.The shooter’s weapons ― a 9 mm handgun and 7.62-caliber rifle ― were recovered at the scene by law enforcement officials.The FBI said it was processing a cell phone, a computer and a camera recovered from Hodgkinson’s van, which was in the parking lot of a YMCA adjacent to the park.Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) confirmed on Wednesday that Hodgkinson had volunteered for his presidential campaign.Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who was also at the practice, told MSNBC that Scalise crawled through the dirt, bleeding, to get away from the shooter.Paul said that a number of aides were lying down during the attack as the shooter fired bullets their way.Paul told CNN that “nobody would’ve survived” had Capitol Police not been there.“It would’ve been a massacre without them,” he said.Noah Nathan, 47, lives in a nearby apartment building and was at the dog park when the shooting took place.The members were practicing for the Congressional Baseball Game, a D.C. tradition dating back to 1909.Police shut down the streets for blocks around the field early Wednesday, and a helicopter was flying overhead.A lockdown has been lifted at the YMCA Alexandria, next to the field where the shooting took place, spokeswoman Dana Rucker told HuffPost.“They are shaken,” Rucker said of YMCA staff.Hodgkinson was member of the YMCA, Rucker said in a statement.Lawmakers from both parties expressed sympathy for the victims.“Our thoughts and prayers are with the members of Congress, their staffs, Capitol Police, first responders, and all others affected,” he said in a statement.During a bipartisan briefing on Capitol Hill later Wednesday, lawmakers discussed the possibility of allowing members of Congress to use campaign funds to bolster security at their private residences.“There’s going to be a review of exactly what funds can and should be used in the event there are security concerns by any member,” said House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.).“We’re looking at that,” Hoyer said.Many previously scheduled events around Capitol Hill were canceled Wednesday, including an event Trump was scheduled to attend at the Department of Labor.Jay Roberts, 60, lives nearby and said the game was “probably one of the few moments with all this rancor and politics that they can have some normalcy.”“I imagined it would be something fun to watch, you know, because evidently it’s partisan politics are put aside, let’s have a softball game, let’s have some fun,” he said.",right
"WASHINGTON — Donald John Trump was inaugurated as the 45th president of the United States on Friday, ushering in a new era that he vowed would shatter the established order and reverse a national decline that he called “this American carnage.”In a ceremony that capped a remarkable rise to power, Mr. Trump presented himself as the leader of a populist uprising to restore lost greatness.“I will fight for you with every breath in my body, and I will never, ever let you down,” Mr. Trump told hundreds of thousands of rain-soaked admirers and onlookers in a forceful 16-minute Inaugural Address from the West Front of the Capitol.Mr. Trump’s ascension amounted to a hostile takeover of a capital facing its most significant disruption in generations.“We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action, constantly complaining but never doing anything about it,” he said.Mr. Trump’s view of the United States was strikingly grim for an Inaugural Address — a country where mothers and children are “trapped in poverty in our inner cities,” where “rusted-out factories” are “scattered like tombstones across the landscape” and where drugs and crime “have stolen too many lives.”“This American carnage,” he declared, “stops right here and stops right now.”He got started right away with rolling back the policies of his predecessor, former President Barack Obama, by issuing orders freezing new regulations from recent weeks and ordering agencies to “ease the burden” of the Affordable Care Act during the transition from repealing to replacing the law.Wearing a dark suit and red tie and accompanied by his wife, Melania, in a powder-blue suit and matching gloves, Mr. Trump took the 35-word oath administered by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. precisely at noon.Mr. Trump assumed the presidency of a country still unsettled after a polarizing election and entered office with less support in polls than any other president in recent history.Throughout the day, there were mostly peaceful protests against the new president.Mr. Trump made only passing efforts to reach out to Democrats beyond thanking Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle, for their handling of the transition.He later praised his defeated opponent, Hillary Clinton, at a lobster-and-beef luncheon with congressional leaders, asking her and former President Bill Clinton to stand for applause.Democrats were not impressed.He added, “It was interesting sitting up onstage with a bunch of billionaires hearing him say how bad the country was.”The National Mall was filled with supporters, many wearing “Make America Great Again” hats and chanting “Trump! Trump! Trump!”While large, the crowds on a soggy day did not rival the energetic throngs at Mr. Obama’s first inauguration eight years ago, according to aerial photographs.Mr. Obama made his exit after the ceremony, flying by helicopter to Joint Base Andrews in the Maryland suburbs, where he thanked former aides and members of his administration before boarding the presidential jet, no longer designated Air Force One, to fly to Palm Springs, Calif., for vacation.Hours before his departure, Mr. Obama posted on Twitter to thank followers and hint that he would not fade away.Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his wife, Jill, rode an Amtrak train to Delaware and the home they have there.The United States has never seen a president quite like Mr. Trump, the son and grandson of immigrants who grew up to become a real estate magnate, casino owner, beauty pageant operator and reality television star whose tumultuous love life played out in the tabloids.Never has the oath been administered to a president who had never served either in public office or as a general in the military.He was also one of the wealthiest presidents ever to enter the White House, with far-reaching business connections that have already raised questions about where his interests end and the country’s begin.But Mr. Trump overcame skeptics when he embarked on what seemed like a quixotic bid for the presidency.His bracing candor, disregard for convention and willingness to offend whole sections of the population to make a point came across as refreshing truth-telling to many Americans disenchanted with Washington elites.For the nation’s 58th inauguration, though, the untraditional president opted to follow tradition.From there, the two presidents shared a limousine to the Capitol, where three other presidents waited: Mr. Clinton, Jimmy Carter and George W. Bush, all of whom opposed Mr. Trump’s election.Mr. Pence, 57, was sworn in at 11:54 a.m., placing his hand on Ronald Reagan’s Bible, which was held by his wife, Karen, as their three adult children, Michael, Charlotte and Audrey, watched.For his oath, Mr. Trump placed his hand on two Bibles held by his wife, one given him by his mother in 1955 just before his ninth birthday and another used by Abraham Lincoln in 1861 and again by Mr. Obama in 2009 and 2013.Standing nearby were his adult children from two previous marriages, Donald Jr., Eric, Ivanka and Tiffany.As Mr. Trump approached the podium, rain began to fall.Mr. Trump said the inauguration was not merely the transfer of power from one president to another.“For too long,” he continued, “a small group in our nation’s capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost.",center
"Donald Trump Jr. Messaged With WikiLeaks During Presidential CampaignPresident Donald Trump’s oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., communicated with WikiLeaks over Twitter direct message during the 2016 presidential race, according to a report in The Atlantic published Monday.According to messages obtained by The Atlantic’s Julia Ioffe, Trump Jr. messaged with the WikiLeaks account between September 2016 and July 2017.Trump Jr. later on Monday confirmed his correspondence with WikiLeaks, posting several screenshots of the Twitter messages.The messages are mostly from WikiLeaks to the president’s son, but Trump Jr. did occasionally respond to the messages.On one occasion, Trump Jr. tweeted a link to a cache of leaked emails after the WikiLeaks account messaged it to him.On another, WikiLeaks wrote it was happy to see the elder Trump mentioning the group on the campaign trail.After Trump won the election, Wikileaks suggested that Trump should prod Australia to appoint the site’s founder, Julian Assange, ambassador to the United States.The White House didn’t immediately respond to a HuffPost request for comment on the report.Vice President Mike Pence, who in an Oct. 14, 2016, interview with Fox News claimed the campaign had not been in contact with WikiLeaks, said in a statement late Monday that he had not known about Trump Jr.’s messages.“The vice president was never aware of anyone associated with the campaign being in contact with WikiLeaks,” said Pence press secretary Alyssa Farah.Weeks before the election, asked if the campaign was “in cahoots” with WikiLeaks, Pence denied it.Trump Jr. became embroiled in the Russia investigation after it was revealed he and other campaign officials met with a Kremlin-backed attorney in June 2016 who had promised damaging information about Clinton.“To the extent they had information concerning the fitness, character or qualifications of a presidential candidate, I believed that I should at least hear them out,” Trump Jr. said in a statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee, one of the congressional committees probing the campaign’s Russia ties, in September.He said the meeting did not lead to anything, and has denied colluding with the Russian government.Trump Jr. is expected to publicly testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee, according to the panel’s top Democrat, Sen.

Moore, after a report that he had made sexual advances toward four teenage girls when he was in his 30s.The Washington Post reported that, in early 1979, Mr. Moore, then a district attorney and later the chief justice of the state Supreme Court, had approached a 14-year-old, eventually kissing her, undressing her, touching her over her bra and underpants, and guiding her hand to touch him over his underwear.The paper found three other women who said they had been pursued by Mr. Moore around the same time, when they were between 16 and 18 years old.Mr. Moore told The Post that the allegations were “completely false and are a desperate political attack by the National Democrat Party and the Washington Post on this campaign.”The story was met with immediate backlash from Republicans in Alabama, several of whom dismissed the women’s stories out of hand.‘Total contrived media garbage’That’s how John Skipper, 66, a former chairman of the Mobile County Republican Party, characterized the claims, speaking to The New York Times.He said that he and other Alabama Republicans would continue to support their candidate and echoed Mr. Moore’s assertion that the Democratic Party had been behind the story.“Most of them will not be shocked,” he said, “and will rather be expecting these shenanigans being pulled by the Democrats as standard operating procedure.”Alabama’s state auditor, Jim Ziegler, told The Washington Examiner that the women’s claims were “much ado about nothing” and said that Mr. Moore had done nothing “immoral or illegal.”Mr. Ziegler sought to justify Mr. Moore’s actions by comparing him to the biblical Joseph, saying, “Mary was a teenager and Joseph was an adult carpenter.“If they believe this man is predatory, they are guilty of allowing him to exist for 40 years,” he said.Daniel Dale, a reporter for The Toronto Star, contacted multiple Republican officials in the state and kept a running report of their responses to the story.Jerry Pow, the party chairman for Bibb County, told Mr. Dale that he’d back Mr. Moore even if the candidate had committed a sex crime.“I would vote for Judge Moore because I wouldn’t want to vote for Doug,” he said.Others, including the party chairmen for Covington County, William Blocker, and Mobile County, John Skipper, dismissed the story as a Democratic trick.Riley Seibenhener, the party chairman in Geneva County, told Mr. Dale that if the allegations were true, he would not support the candidate.“I know that 14-year-olds dont’t make good decisions,” he said.",center
"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Friday reversed the government’s decision to start allowing hunters to import trophies of elephants that were killed in two African countries, pending a further review.His evening Twitter message reversed a decision by his own administration over Zimbabwe that was announced this week and promoted as recently as Friday afternoon by the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders.“Put big game trophy decision on hold until such time as I review all conservation facts,” Mr. Trump tweeted.Ryan Zinke, the interior secretary, said in a statement later Friday night that the decision applied to two African countries, though it did not name them.“President Trump and I have talked, and both believe that conservation and healthy herds are critical,” the statement said.The United States Fish and Wildlife Service had signaled its intention to end the 2014 ban, citing Zimbabwe’s conservation efforts.Nearly two weeks ago, the department also waived the ban in a similar manner for Zambia.Zambia and Zimbabwe have had mixed success in recent years maintaining or increasing their elephant population, according to the Great Elephant Census, a project financed by Paul G. Allen, a founder of Microsoft.It is unclear why Mr. Trump reversed the decision, but the announcement faced backlash from both conservatives and liberals.On social media, photos were being shared of Mr. Trump’s two elder sons hunting on safari in Zimbabwe, including one photo that showed Donald Trump Jr. with a severed elephant tail in one hand and a knife in the other.The White House argued that the hunting would bring money to local communities and incentivize efforts to protect elephants.“This review established that both Zambia and Zimbabwe had met new standards, strict international conservation standards that allowed Americans to resume hunting in those countries,” she told reporters during a news briefing.Under President Barack Obama, the practice had been banned because of a lack of data on conservation efforts in Zimbabwe.Safari Club International, a trophy-hunting organization that sued the Obama administration in 2014 in an effort to challenge the ban and was the first to report the policy change on Tuesday, lashed out against the news media and “anti-hunters” for swaying the Trump administration to lift the trophy ban.“The fight for the freedom to hunt is far from over,” Paul Babaz, the organization’s president, said in a statement.But environmental groups applauded the reversal on Friday and called for more restrictions on trophy hunting, which has faced increased scrutiny, especially after an American dentist killed Cecil, a lion beloved in Zimbabwe, in 2015.“It’s great that public outrage has forced Trump to reconsider this despicable decision,” said Tanya Sanerib, a senior lawyer with the Center for Biological Diversity, “but it takes more than a tweet to stop trophy hunters from slaughtering elephants and lions.”Ms. Sanders also confirmed Friday that a near-total ban on the commercial trade of African elephant ivory enforced during the Obama administration would remain in place.",liberal

Ed Royce on Friday questioned the action because of concerns not only about African wildlife but U.S. national security, citing the political upheaval in Zimbabwe, where the longtime president was placed under house arrest this week by the military.""The administration should withdraw this decision until Zimbabwe stabilizes,"" the committee chairman said in a statement.Royce said that when carefully regulated, conservation hunts could help the wildlife population, but ""that said, this is the wrong move at the wrong time.""The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said in a written notice issued Thursday that permitting elephants from Zimbabwe and Zambia to be brought back as trophies will raise money for conservation programs.""Legal, well-regulated sport hunting as part of a sound management program can benefit certain species by providing incentives to local communities to conserve those species and by putting much-needed revenue back into conservation,"" the agency said in a statement.The illicit demand for elephant ivory has led to devastating losses from illegal poaching as the natural habitat available for the animals to roam has also dwindled by more than half.Two other lawmakers, Rep. Vern Buchanan, R-Fla., and Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., co-chairs of the Congressional Animal Protection Caucus, assailed the administration's decision.",center
"WASHINGTON ― In recent years, the opposing party approached Supreme Court nomination hearings by honing in on the nominee’s character and temperament or on one particular case that could possibly derail the nominee.The four days of Senate Judiciary Committee hearings held this past week for President Donald Trump’s nominee to fill the late Justice Antonin Scalia’s seat, Judge Neil Gorsuch, were different.At the base of this argument was a simple question that has been dogging Democrats ever since the infamous Bush v. Gore decision on the 2000 presidential election: Is the Supreme Court rigged to benefit corporations, the wealthy and, well, Republicans?Pressing this question did not knock Gorsuch off his steady stream of non-answers.Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) made this point abundantly clear when he pointed to the series of 5-4 decisions made under Roberts’ leadership that have changed laws to help Republicans get elected, big donors gain more influence in politics through campaign contributions and corporations gain more economic and political power.“I think these 5-4 decisions are a problem, you said sometimes ― I think I’m quoting you correctly ― sometimes big corporations can capture an agency,” Whitehouse said to Gorsuch.On this week’s episode of The Huffington Post’s “So That Happened” podcast, 2016 Democratic House candidate Zephyr Teachout, a constitutional law professor at Fordham University School of Law, said the Democrats took the right approach by aiming their fire at the court as an institution that shapes our economy and our politics.“I thought both Whitehouse and others rightly pointed out that after Roberts’ confirmation we gotta pull away that fake story that you’re just calling balls and strikes,” Teachout said.Gorsuch, who worked on former President George W. Bush’s 2004 reelection campaign and as a lawyer in his Justice Department, provided the expected performance past court nominees had given during his appearance; he stated that he would be shocked by politics coming into a courtroom.It is no surprise that Democrats find little need to take this opinion seriously anymore.Sen. Pat Leahy (D-Vt.) called this “an extraordinary blockade.” “It was totally unprecedented in our country’s whole history,” he added.Responding to Gorsuch’s stated belief that justices have no partisan leanings, Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) explained, “And you know, you said earlier, there are no Democratic judges, there are no Republican judges.In addition, Democrats are still irritated at Roberts for promising to call only “balls and strikes” in his 2005 confirmation hearing.Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) blasted Roberts’ decision in Shelby County for creating a whole new constitutional doctrine out of whole cloth, “So, so much for judicial modesty,” she said.The Roberts Court has done much to reshape power in the United States.After Gorsuch repeatedly stated that there was ample room for Congress to legislate without worrying about court decisions, Democrats reminded him of how the court’s decisions play a key role in shaping who is elected to Congress and, therefore, what bills can be passed in the first place.“[B]y tilting the political playing field so heavily toward corporations and against individuals, hasn’t the court impacted the composition of who is in Congress and made it therefore even harder for Congress to taking meaningful,” Hirono said.Whitehouse asked about the court’s controversial Citizens United decision, “What could be more involved in politics than to open this ocean of dark money that’s flooded into our politics?”Democrats on the committee appeared frustrated that Gorsuch refused to acknowledge the court’s role in transforming both the political and economic worlds the country’s citizens operate in.",center
"Donald Trump assumed the nation’s highest office Friday as the 45th president of the United States, vowing in a tough inaugural address to restore prosperity and “fight” for the country “with every breath.”In a succinct speech heavy on populist themes, the new president told Americans across the country they will “never be ignored again” and promised concrete results.“The time for empty talk is over. Now arrives the hour of action,” he said.The president addressed a packed crowd of spectators stretching from the Capitol across the National Mall on a mild but overcast and at-times drizzly day, after taking the oath of office along with Vice President Mike Pence. But the address was stitched together, more broadly, by an appeal for a “new national pride” and a rediscovery of American patriotism, as he described this as a salve for the country’s divisions.“When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice,” he said.He also rebuked those who have held power in Washington, saying a small group reaped the rewards of government while “the people did not share” in Washington’s wealth.The address completes Trump’s remarkable journey from political outsider written off by countless Beltway pundits to the most powerful man in the country.In blunt and unvarnished terms similar to the language used during his nomination acceptance address last summer, Trump on Friday lamented the jobs lost to foreign rivals – he described “rusted out factories scattered like tombstones” across the land – and the crime in America’s cities.“This American carnage stops right here and stops right now,” Trump said.Trump cast his presidency as a return to power for the people and vowed never to let them down.“From this day forward, it’s going to be only America first,” Trump said. He also vowed to eradicate Islamic terrorism.Telling the American people this is “your moment” and “your day,” Trump closed his speech with the promise that started it all: “We will make America great again.”As Barack and Michelle Obama depart the White House after eight years in office, Trump will immediately be confronted with the challenge of governing, as he attempts to apply his CEO experience to running the nation. An immediate task for the new administration will be to get Trump’s Cabinet nominees confirmed. Before he spoke on Friday, throngs of protesters were causing disruptions on the edges of the security zone in Washington. While dozens of House Democrats boycotted Friday’s ceremonies – a move that fueled disputes with Trump’s team over the weekend – other prominent Democrats and past presidents of both parties were in attendance for the transfer of power. “I will never stop believing in our country & its future,” she wrote.Donald and Melania Trump met with the Obamas earlier Friday morning after attending a church service in Washington.

"President Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., corresponded with WikiLeaks before the 2016 presidential election, a dialogue of which the president’s son confirmed Monday night on Twitter.In a series of tweets, Trump Jr. produced “the entire chain of messages with @wikileaks (with my whopping 3 responses) which one of the congressional committees has chosen to selectively leak.The Atlantic first reported on Monday that Trump Jr. received a private message from the WikiLeaks Twitter account on September 20, 2016 — a message shown in the tweets produced by the president’s son.“A PAC run anti-Trump site putintrump.org is about to launch,” WikiLeaks wrote.Trump Jr. replied, “Off the record I don’t know who that is, but I’ll ask around.In a separate October 2016 exchange, WikiLeaks urged Trump Jr. to “comment on/push this story” about then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton wanting to “just drone” Julian Assange, the Wikileaks founder.“Already did that earlier today,” Trump Jr. later replied.The messages obtained by The Atlantic were turned over to investigators by Trump Jr.’s attorneys.“Over the last several months, we have worked cooperatively with each of the committees and have voluntarily turned over thousands of documents in response to their requests,” Alan Futerfas, an attorney for Trump Jr., said in a statement.“Putting aside the question as to why or by whom such documents, provided to Congress under promises of confidentiality, have been selectively leaked, we can say with confidence that we have no concerns about these documents and any questions raised about them have been easily answered in the appropriate forum.”According to the report, the messages are part of a long correspondence between WikiLeaks and Trump Jr., though Trump Jr. seemed to ignore many of the messages, including some which urged him to release “one or more of your father’s tax returns.”President Trump’s attorney Ty Cobb told Fox News on Monday that he was not aware that Donald Trump Jr.’s attorneys provided these documents to congressional investigators, but said there is likely no legal issue, from what he knows of the documents.Wikileaks publisher Julian Assange tweeted about the report on Monday, saying that the organization couldn’t “confirm” the messages with Trump Jr.Wikileaks “does not keep such records and the Atlantic’s presentation is edited and clearly does not have the full context,” Assange wrote.“WikiLeaks loves its pending publications and ignores those who ask for details,” Assange continued.“WikiLeaks has such chutzpah that it allegedly tried to convince Trump Jr to leak his father’s tax returns & his own “Russian lawyer meeting” emails (he did),” Assange wrote.Assange also claimed that the “full text of alleged DMs with context provides a different reading, unsurprisingly.”This is not the first time that Trump Jr. has been in the spotlight, and has had his actions brought into question amid the larger probe into Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates in the 2016 presidential election.In June 2016, Trump Jr. accepted a now-highly scrutinized meeting with Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya, after he allegedly was promised “dirt” on Hillary Clinton.Fox News’ Matt Richardson and John Roberts contributed to this report.",center
"WASHINGTON — Senate Democrats on Thursday vowed to filibuster the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, signaling an imminent partisan showdown over the nominee’s fate and the future of century-old rules in the chamber.As committee hearings on Judge Gorsuch concluded on Thursday, it appeared increasingly likely that Republicans hoping to elevate President Trump’s choice for the court would resort to replacing longstanding rules with a simple majority vote on his confirmation.While a parade of witnesses addressed the Senate Judiciary Committee, trading dueling views of Judge Gorsuch, the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, went to the Senate floor and announced that he would try to lead Democrats in blocking an up-or-down vote on Judge Gorsuch.“After careful deliberation I have concluded that I cannot support Judge Neil Gorsuch’s nomination to the Supreme Court,” Mr. Schumer said, citing concerns over Judge Gorsuch’s record on workers’ rights and his degree of independence, adding, “My vote will be no, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.”Judge Gorsuch must earn the support of at least eight Democrats to break a filibuster — a threshold he is not on track to meet, at least so far, according to interviews and internal party discussions.If Democrats band together, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, has threatened to pursue the so-called nuclear option eliminating the filibuster for Supreme Court selections.Some Republicans have expressed reservations about changing the rules, but Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said Thursday that he would relent if it meant seating Judge Gorsuch.Mr. McConnell has said he wants the Senate to confirm Judge Gorsuch to fill the vacancy, which was created by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia more than a year ago, before departing for a scheduled recess on April 7.On Thursday, Mr. McConnell accused Democrats of engaging in “obstructionist tactics” to block a well-qualified nominee.“Despite the judge’s outstanding performance, his exceptional background, and the extensive support he’s received from people of all political leanings, we know that some Senate Democrats will continue trying to come up with any reason to delay the confirmation process,” Mr. McConnell said of Judge Gorsuch.During the four days of hearings, even Judge Gorsuch’s critics did not dispute his credentials.“We do not give the ‘well qualified’ rating lightly,” said Nancy Scott Degan, an official of the bar association.The group had also given its highest rating to Judge Garland.Four years ago, when Democrats controlled the Senate and Republican senators were blockading Mr. Obama’s appeals court and executive branch nominees, Democrats changed the chamber’s rules to bar filibusters for such positions — but left the filibuster rule in place for Supreme Court nominations.Republicans have cited this history often in accusing their colleagues of hypocrisy on Judge Gorsuch.To eliminate the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees, Republicans would need to vote in virtual lock step: The party effectively has only 51 votes right now because one member, Senator Johnny Isakson of Georgia, is recuperating from back surgery, so just two Republican senators could block a rules change.Still, Judge Gorsuch’s nomination is broadly popular among conservatives.“I don’t think we should move forward on the Gorsuch nomination until the nomination of Merrick Garland has been dealt with fairly,” Senator Thomas R. Carper, Democrat of Delaware, said on Thursday, signaling his support for a filibuster.Another moderate Democrat, Senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, also said he would reject Judge Gorsuch and join the filibuster effort.Others in the group were less eager to declare their intentions.“I’m going to keep on my theme I’ve been on for a couple of months,” said Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri.Even before Judge Gorsuch’s nomination, Ms. McCaskill inadvertently drew the ire of liberal activists by expressing support for “a full confirmation hearing process and a vote,” before making clear she believed in a 60-vote threshold.Despite the escalating political friction, the atmosphere in the hearing room on Thursday was often more perfunctory than passionate, as panels of witnesses selected by Democrats and Republicans alternately expressed concerns that Judge Gorsuch was too conservative or praised him as a well-qualified and careful judge.Two of Judge Gorsuch’s former colleagues on the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, in Denver — Deanell Reece Tacha, appointed by President Ronald Reagan, and Robert Harlan Henry, appointed by President Bill Clinton — praised his intellect and temperament.But others expressed concerns.Jameel Jaffer, who litigated national-security cases against the government as the former deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, urged the committee to scrutinize more closely Judge Gorsuch’s views on executive power and individual rights.Mr. Jaffer pointed to documents showing, for example, that Judge Gorsuch had worked to get Congress to enact a law stripping courts of jurisdiction to hear lawsuits by Guantánamo Bay detainees, and in one email chain he criticized law firms that helped represent prisoners in seeking judicial review of their detention.On Wednesday, Judge Gorsuch told the committee that the email had not been “my finest moment” and that he had been “blowing off steam with a friend, privately.”",liberal
"Lawmakers at the scene of Wednesday’s baseball practice shooting described themselves as “sitting ducks” and said the violence would have been a “massacre” if not for Majority Whip Steve Scalise's detail -- spurring new questions over whether congressional security practices should be overhauled.Thursday night, the MedStar Washington Hospital Center issued a statement saying Scalise ""underwent a second surgery related to his internal injuries and a broken bone in his leg.Scalise, R-La., like other members of leadership, is assigned a full-time security detail from U.S. Capitol Police, who guard him in Washington and at home in his district.“If Scalise was not there, he’s the one with security detail, we wouldn’t have had any protection and God knows how bad that might have been,” Rep. Brad Wenstrup, R-Ohio, told ""Fox & Friends.""Rep. Dave Brat, R-Va., acknowledged the incident has sparked new security questions for members without assigned police protection at events outside Capitol Hill.He, along with several other members of Congress, suggested the most critical change may be to boost security for large lawmaker gatherings, even informal ones like the baseball practice in Alexandria, Va.“We already had concerns and we have great law enforcement at home, first responders do a great job, but this makes you anticipate every event now in a new way,” Brat said on Fox News’ “America’s News HQ” on Wednesday.Brat said lawmakers “may need to recalibrate public events,” while also suggesting “tighter security” at town halls -- which most congressional lawmakers have scheduled through the summer recess.The Wednesday attack injured Scalise; Matt Mika, a lobbyist for Tyson Foods; Zack Barth, a staffer from Texas Rep. Roger Williams’ office; and two U.S. Capitol Police officers, Special Agents Crystal Griner and David Bailey.“Without Capitol Hill police, it would have been a massacre—we had no defense—we had no defense at all,” Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said on ""Fox & Friends.""Lawmakers have appealed for more security before, including after the 2011 shooting of then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords.But there are broad questions at hand in boosting security beyond that: particularly, does it hurt democracy to put an added barrier between lawmakers and constituents?“I bet most members of Congress would say they don’t want [a] security detail—I sure don’t,” Rep. Mike Doyle, D-Pa., manager of the Democratic congressional baseball team, told reporters.Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich lauded the current system where lawmakers interact with the people on a regular basis in settings like grocery stores.“We start surrounding these folks with layers of guards—it will really cripple the ability to be a free society,” he said on “Outnumbered.”Gingrich added: “We are a free country, and we’re gonna run the risk of freedom.”Rep. Williams backed Gingrich's comments in a press conference on Capitol Hill Wednesday.But Williams suggested he would feel “safer” if he were allowed to carry a gun on Capitol Hill, reminding reporters that he’s “a big Second Amendment guy” -- and said “we probably ought to take a look at our security in big groups like that.”Doyle, too, suggested that could be the solution: “I think when you’re in an area with 30 or 40 members, where anyone can walk through, we need to re-think that—but I think most members would tell you they feel fine and they’re not looking for any security.”Rep. Thomas Massie, R-K.Y., took calls for additional security a step further on Thursday by re-introducing legislation that would allow those who have concealed carry permits in their home states to carry in Washington D.C.U.S. Capitol Police have not announced any increased security measures for congressional lawmakers, but said they will “continue to provide a robust and visible presence” around the Capitol.James Norton, who was deputy assistant secretary at Department of Homeland Security under the George W. Bush administration, told Fox News that staffing each member of Congress with a personal security detail would cost billions and acknowledged the unwillingness of some members to have additional layers of security.“You have to consider that there is a lot of information for the public—obviously members want to give as much information as they can—a lot of calendars are broadcast, social media, information is readily available,” Norton said.Brooke Singman is a Reporter for Fox News.",liberal
"WASHINGTON — Two days after suddenly halting his own administration’s decision to begin allowing hunters to import elephants killed in two African countries, President Donald Trump called such trophy hunting a “horror show” and said he’s unlikely to change his mind and allow such imports.“Big-game trophy decision will be announced next week but will be very hard pressed to change my mind that this horror show in any way helps conservation of Elephants or any other animal,” he posted to Twitter Sunday evening.In the face of widespread public backlash, Tump announced late Friday that he has suspended — at least for now — his administration’s decision to reverse an Obama-era ban on the importation of elephant trophies from Zimbabwe and Zambia.“Put big game trophy decision on hold until such time as I review all conservation facts,” he posted to Twitter.Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said in a statement on Twitter that he and Trump “believe that conservation & healthy herds are critical.”As HuffPost reported Wednesday, the administration optedto lift the 2014 ban after determining that sport hunting of elephants in those African countries would “enhance the survival of the species in the wild,” a spokesperson for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said.The decision regarding elephants was made public not by the federal agency but via a celebratory news release early Tuesday from Safari Club International, a trophy hunting advocacy group that, along with the National Rifle Association, sued to block the 2014 ban.The Safari Club’s political action committees donated a collective $24,500 to Trump’s presidential campaign and Zinke’s 2014 and 2016 congressional campaigns, according to Federal Election Commission data.Conservation groups celebrated Trump’s sudden change in course Friday, which was believed to be a response to public pressure.“It’s great that public outrage has forced Trump to reconsider this despicable decision, but it takes more than a tweet to stop trophy hunters from slaughtering elephants and lions,” Tanya Sanerib, senior attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement.In a post to Twitter, Wayne Pacelle, the CEO of The Humane Society of the United States, said he was “grateful” that Trump would reconsider.The elephant trophy decision drew national headlines and a fierce response from celebrities and others across social media.A day after Trump’s suspension, the Safari Club sent out a “call to arms,” encouraging hunters to contact Trump and Zinke and “tell them how much you appreciate the efforts of the Fish & Wildlife Service to remove barriers to sustainable use conservation for African wildlife.”“The news from Africa could not have been better for hunters or for anyone who loves or defends hunting culture,” the group wrote.African elephants have been listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act since 1978.The FWS concluded that Zimbabwe has made strides to improve elephant management and anti-poaching efforts, according to a notice published Friday in the Federal Register.Rep. Ed Royce (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, was among the many people who called on Trump to abandon his trophy hunting decision.“Elephants and other big game in Africa are blood currency for terrorist organizations, and they are being killed at an alarming rate,” Royce said.Hours before Trump’s review announcement, the FWS defended its decision as “part of a robust United States conservation strategy that seeks to eliminate poaching and associated wildlife trafficking.”",center
"WASHINGTON ― The White House relayed President Donald Trump’s response late Thursday to bombshell allegations that Alabama GOP Senate nominee Roy Moore sexually molested a 14-year-old girl in 1979.White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, traveling with the president on his trip to Asia, told reporters that Trump “believes that we cannot allow a mere allegation ― in this case, one from many years ago ― to destroy a person’s life” but that if the allegations are true, “Judge Moore will do the right thing and step aside.”A spokesperson for Vice President Mike Pence said the veep “found the allegations in the story disturbing and believes, if true, this would disqualify anyone from serving in office.”Moore’s campaign denied the allegations, which The Washington Post first reported, telling the paper the accusations of four women are “the very definition of fake news.”On Thursday, numerous Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill called on Moore to drop out of the race ― if the allegations are true.During his 2016 campaign, Trump dismissed allegations of sexual misconduct against himself from more than a dozen women and threatened to sue some of his accusers.In September, Moore, a controversial judge in Alabama, won the primary for the special election.Trump notably backed Strange over Moore, though many members of his base, including former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, supported Moore.But after Moore won, Trump disavowed his endorsement of Strange, deleting tweets in support of him.",center

"President Trump, 24 hours from his self-imposed deadline for picking a new F.B.I. director, told reporters on Thursday that he was “very close” to choosing a successor to James B. Comey, and he named Joseph I. Lieberman, the former Democratic senator and vice-presidential nominee, as a finalist.But members of Mr. Trump’s staff — alarmed by his rapid embrace of Mr. Lieberman, a charming 75-year-old political operator with no federal law enforcement experience — have quietly urged him to take more time to make such a critical hire.Mr. Lieberman, who served three terms in the Senate as a Democrat and one as an independent, would be an atypical choice to lead the F.B.I., whose agents prize the bureau’s independence as one of Washington’s few apolitical institutions.Administration officials described the search as fluid and said the president and his team were keeping the decision-making process closely held to avoid the leaks that Mr. Trump believes are endemic to the West Wing.Still, Mr. Trump, speaking briefly with reporters in the Oval Office as he met with President Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia, offered an emphatic “yes” when asked whether Mr. Lieberman was among the finalists.“We need a great director of the F.B.I. I cherish the F.B.I.It was unclear whether the president’s acknowledgment that Mr. Lieberman was a finalist was intended to stoke the “Apprentice”-style frenzy of speculation he has favored with other high-profile picks, only to opt for a lesser-known candidate.Mr. Trump is still seeking applicants, and some aides, along with many law enforcement officials, have suggested that he hire from within the agency to repair some of the damage to morale wrought by Mr. Comey’s sudden firing.Mr. McCabe, a veteran agent who joined the bureau in 1996 and once specialized in Russian organized crime, was named deputy director in 2016.All three men are under consideration, the administration officials said, even if Mr. Lieberman, who was Al Gore’s running mate in the 2000 presidential campaign, is the front-runner.Mr. Trump and Mr. Lieberman had good chemistry when they met privately, one White House aide said — a key ingredient for Mr. Trump in hiring people.Democrats pushed back hard on that notion, casting the conservative Mr. Lieberman as a Democrat in name only and noting that he publicly supported Mr. Trump’s pick of Michael T. Flynn as his first national security adviser.But casting Mr. Lieberman as the most likely choice did have one immediate advantage: It appealed to Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who had suggested this week that the firestorm over Mr. Trump’s ouster of Mr. Comey was as bad as Watergate.The White House remains divided, and several senior officials expressed serious doubts about Mr. Lieberman.If Mr. Trump picks Mr. Lieberman, one adviser said he might serve for a short stint — to lend his bipartisan reputation to a president badly in needed of credibility — instead of the full term.Others on Mr. Trump’s list are former Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma and former Representative Mike Rogers of Michigan, both Republicans.Also interviewed were two other judges, Michael J.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Monday said the F.B.I. ruined the life of his former national security adviser and said his Democratic opponent for president, Hillary Clinton, suffered no consequences after she lied “many times” to the F.B.I.Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump’s first national security adviser, pleaded guilty on Friday to lying to the F.B.I. when he was questioned early this year about his conversations with the Russian ambassador.As he left for Utah on Monday, the president said he felt “very badly” for Mr. Flynn, whom he fired in February for lying to the vice president about the content of these conversations.Mr. Trump’s comments Monday on Mr. Flynn come at a time when the special counsel investigation is focusing intensely on the president’s inner circle.“I feel badly for General Flynn,” Mr. Trump said on Monday. “I feel very badly.Mr. Trump did not cite specifically what Mrs. Clinton said that he considered a lie.Mrs. Clinton gave a voluntary interview to the bureau in July 2016 during its investigation into whether she or her aides broke the law by corresponding through a private email server set up for her use as secretary of state.",right
"WASHINGTON ― The House intelligence committee is preparing to issue subpoenas against Michael Flynn after the former national security adviser denied a request to voluntarily turn over documents related to the committee’s Russia probe.Rep. Adam Schiff (Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the committee, said on Wednesday that the committee is prepared to use “whatever compulsory process we need” to obtain information from Flynn if he does not cooperate with the subpoenas.Citing the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, Flynn’s lawyer said on Monday that Flynn would not comply with subpoenas from the Senate intelligence committee, which is conducting its own parallel investigation into Russia’s interference in the election and whether it colluded with President Donald Trump’s associates.The House committee’s subpoenas “will be designed to maximize our chance of getting the information that we need,” Schiff told reporters at a breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor.Schiff said he is “skeptical” that the committee would agree to grant Flynn immunity in the future in exchange for information.The committee is also looking for ways to obtain documentation of Trump’s conversations with top intelligence and law enforcement officials involved in a separate federal Russia probe.Trump implied earlier this month that he had “tapes” of discussions with recently fired FBI Director James Comey that would be damaging to Comey.“That could be further evidence of an attempt to interfere with the investigation,” Schiff said of Trump’s reported request to Coats and Rogers.Despite concerns about Trump interfering with ongoing investigations into his campaign, Schiff warned that it is premature for Democrats on Capitol Hill to push for impeachment.“There’s a legal standard that needs to be met for impeachment and then there’s a very practical standard that has to be met,” Schiff said.“If the Republicans in Congress or people at large in the country feel this is simply a way to nullify an election that others didn’t agree with, then you’re not going to meet the practical standards necessary,” Schiff said.",liberal

Washington is locked in a battle over what to do about the Bush-era tax cuts, which expire at the end of the year. At the same time, Congress needs to make a legislative move to keep the government funded before the 112th Congress takes over in January.Democrats were hoping to force a more ambitious agenda into the final weeks, including the ratification of the New Start treaty, a military authorization bill that would repeal the “don’t ask, don’t tell” provision, the extension of unemployment funds and the Dream Act, an immigration bill.“If they really cared about creating jobs, they should stop blocking a preservation of unemployment insurance, which would create or save hundred of thousands of jobs,” Jim Manley, a spokesman for Mr. Reid, said in an e-mail.

"WASHINGTON — Republican Congressional candidates on Monday intensified efforts to inject the divide over construction of an Islamic center near ground zero into the midterm campaigns while the Senate’s top Democrat said he objected to the mosque being built there.Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Senate majority leader and a Democrat facing a difficult re-election fight, said through a spokesman that those who plan to erect the Islamic center should look elsewhere.“The First Amendment protects freedom of religion,” said Jim Manley, a top adviser to Mr. Reid.In a number of releases and statements, Republican House and Senate candidates challenged Democrats like Mr. Reid to make their positions clear on the construction of a mosque and community center about two blocks from the site of the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, in New York City.“Ground zero is hallowed ground to Americans,” Elliott Maynard, a Republican trying to unseat Representative Nick J. Rahall II, a Democrat, in West Virginia’s Third District, said in a typical statement.Republicans said Mr. Obama’s defense of the right of the developers to pursue the project showed that he was out of touch with average Americans.“It is very troubling to see President Obama again turning a deaf ear to the thoughts and concerns of a majority of Americans,” said James Renacci, a Republican candidate in Ohio’s 16th District, who said people at a recent public meeting were furious about the mosque proposal.The remarks were a rare instance in this campaign season when Republicans have strayed from a focus on economic issues in their push for substantial gains in the House and Senate in November.Some leading Democrats said it was the president’s role to stand up for constitutional rights in the mosque dispute.Representative James E. Clyburn, the No. 3 House Democrat, said Monday that “articulating the constitutional principles” on which the country was founded and “calling for tolerance on the part of all of its people” were part of “a presidential act worth exercising.”Privately, many Democrats were not pleased that the issue had been thrown into their laps during the summer recess as they believed they had been making inroads by talking about how some Republicans support privatizing Social Security.Some also said the White House should not have put lawmakers on the spot in the first place and could have been better prepared for the president’s statement, lining up religious and community leaders to offer support for the right to build the mosque and undermine Republican attacks.Other Democrats said they did not see the fight resonating strongly outside New York and did not expect it to become a defining campaign issue.Representative Jerrold Nadler, a Democrat who represents the district that includes ground zero, said he doubted that the fight over the mosque would inflict much damage on fellow Democrats in the November elections.Mr. Nadler, whose view is that the developers were entitled to build the mosque at the selected location if they choose, said, “Ultimately I suspect that once this simmers down in a few weeks, people will realize that everybody’s liberty is at stake here.”The planned community center, perhaps 15 stories tall, would be built in three adjacent buildings two blocks north of ground zero, though one building, owned by Consolidated Edison, has yet to be sold.The developer, Sharif el-Gamal, a real estate investor born in New York, has said the center would include meeting rooms, a prayer space, a 500-seat auditorium and a pool.Before Mr. Obama spoke out, leading Republican figures like Newt Gingrich, a former speaker of the House, and Sarah Palin, the party’s 2008 vice-presidential nominee, had been voicing opposition to the Islamic center.But Mr. Gingrich showed no sign of backing down on Monday.Democratic campaign officials accused Republicans of exploiting the Sept. 11 attacks, noting that their outrage over the Islamic center came just weeks after many House Republicans opposed a new medical program to monitor and treat emergency workers and others suffering ill effects from exposure to hazardous materials at ground zero.",center

"WASHINGTON — Michael Steele, chairman of the Republican National Committee, drew fierce criticism and a call for his resignation on Friday after declaring at a party fund-raiser that the United States was on the wrong side of history with its conflict in Afghanistan, a military fight he called “a war of Obama’s choosing.”“This is not something the United States had actively prosecuted or wanted to engage in,” Mr. Steele said in a speech Thursday night in Connecticut in which he offered a strong critique of President Obama’s military strategy.“It was the president who was trying to be cute by half by flipping a script demonizing Iraq, while saying the battle really should be Afghanistan,” Mr. Steele said, according to a video of his remarks that was circulated by Democrats on Friday.Mr. Steele, seeking to clarify his remarks, issued a statement on Friday afternoon, saying, “There is no question that America must win the war on terror.”His remarks were the latest in a string of controversial statements that he has made as party chairman.The war in Afghanistan, which has entered its ninth year, was started by former President George W. Bush in response to the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.Mr. Steele’s comments prompted William Kristol, editor of the Weekly Standard and a leading voice of conservative support for the war in Afghanistan, to call for Mr. Steele’s resignation as party leader.“Your tenure has, of course, been marked by gaffes and embarrassments, but I for one have never paid much attention to them, and have never thought they would matter much to the success of the causes and principles we share,” Mr. Kristol wrote Friday.He added, “There are, of course, those who think we should pull out of Afghanistan, and they’re certainly entitled to make their case.A spokesman for the Democratic National Committee, Brad Woodhouse, said Mr. Steele was “betting against our troops and rooting for failure in Afghanistan.”When Mr. Steele made the remarks, he was speaking to Republican contributors at a fund-raiser in Connecticut.In his statement on Friday afternoon, Mr. Steele did not respond to the call for his resignation.“For the sake of the security of the free world, our country must give our troops the support necessary to win this war,” Mr. Steele said.He added, with a reference to Gen.

"Larry Summers, the outgoing chairman of the National Economic Council, just told a group of reporters that failure to pass a package like the tax deal announced by President Obama this week “would significantly increase the risk” of a double-dip recession.Mr. Summers made the remarks at a briefing with the White House press secretary Robert Gibbs and David Axelrod, the president’s top political adviser.In brief remarks after meeting with President Bronislaw Komorowski of Poland, Mr. Obama on Wednesday emphatically disputed that Democrats generally feel betrayed by his deal with Congressional Republicans on the tax cuts, saying that “the more who look at it, the more will say this makes sense.”“I just think it’s very important for Congress to examine the agreement, look at the facts, have a thorough debate, but get this done.In a joint appearance at the White House with Mr. Komorowski, Mr. Obama said that “economists across the country have upwardly revised their forecasts for growth” after the tax deal was announced on Monday night.Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. planned to return to Capitol Hill this afternoon to meet with House Democrats as President Obama and the White House sought to quell the uproar among liberals about the tax deal.Officials said Mr. Biden will travel to the Hill around 4:30 p.m. in an attempt to sell the compromise Mr. Obama announced this week.Mr. Biden’s visit and the president’s comments come as the administration’s message machine started churning out statements of support.To counter condemnations from some Democrats in Congress, the White House circulated a series of e-mails quoting endorsements from private-sector economic forecasters, liberal as well as conservative analysts, and Democratic officeholders, including an obscure freshman House member, Representative Gary Peters of Michigan.By noon, the White House press office had released supportive comments from Antonio Villaraigosa, the mayor of Los Angeles, and Mr. Peters.John Podesta, a former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton and a close ally of Mr. Obama, issued a statement calling the tax deal “a steep price” but saying the president was “right to choose helping working Americans over a December conflagration.” David Axelrod, the president’s chief political adviser, said on CNN’s “American Morning” that middle-class Americans were “going to get screwed” if their tax cuts were not extended at the end of the year.The administration was quick to highlight comments from Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody’sEconomy.com, projecting that the Obama tax deal would increase economic growth next year by 1.25 percentage points and create 1.6 million jobs.But the public relations offensive is being met with public expressions of outrage from Mr. Obama’s base, including the most liberal members of Congress and spokesmen for interest groups on the left.Close to three dozen House Democrats have signed a letter from Representative Peter Welch, Democrat of Vermont, calling the tax deal “fiscally irresponsible” and “grossly unfair.”Mr. Biden’s visit with the House Democrats is likely to be as contentious as the one that he led with their Senate colleagues on Tuesday — if not more so.Despite the closed-door lunchtime meeting, Senate aides told The Times afterward that about 30 Democratic senators remained “firmly opposed” to the president’s negotiated deal after hearing from the vice president.In the House, Democratic lawmakers said Wednesday morning that the sense of disappointment with the president remained strong.“I don’t think it was preordained that if we had a deadlock, they would have won it,” said Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, in an interview on MSNBC.",center

"Outgoing White House economic adviser Larry Summers warned Wednesday that failure to pass a new tax cut compromise would significantly raise the risk of a double-dip recession.""To pass this bill in the next couple of weeks would materially increase the risk that the economy would stall out and we would have a double dip,"" he told reporters at the White House.Summers added that he thinks Congress will pass the deal President Obama struck with Republicans, an agreement that has come under withering criticism from liberal Democrats over the two-year extension of tax cuts for the rich as well as the middle class.Summers said that he doesn't think that Congress would take a step that ""materially increases the risk that this economy will stall out.""Positive reviews coming in from economists, Summers said, show the deal is the right thing to do.Sen. Jon Kyl, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, told reporters that a tax cut bill could be on the Senate floor as early as Thursday.But, in a surprise move, Senate Democrats, meeting behind closed doors to discuss the tax deal, have asked the administration for ""changes"" to the bill, according to Sen Dick Durbin, D-Ill., the No. 2 Democrat in the chamber.Kyl said an official analysis and price tag, referred to as a ""score,"" from the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) are not yet ready, but that the Senate could move to the bill anyway.Vice President Biden traveled to the Capitol Wednesday for a private meeting with House Democrats who are resisting the deal, saying it gives away too much to the wealthy.Some Democrats are unhappy that Obama agreed to extend expiring tax cuts not just for the middle class but also for higher earners, and that he agreed to impose a lower estate tax on wealthy heirs.In return, Democrats would get extended jobless benefits for people who have been unemployed for long stretches.Liberals are going as far as trying to prevent outgoing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi from bringing the tax cut compromise to the floor.Reps. Peter DeFazio of Oregon, and Jim McDermott and Jay Inslee of Washington state are crafting a letter to share with the House Democratic Caucus that would try to block the bill from seeing the light of day.""There does not seem to be a majority of the Democrats who support the deal negotiated by Vice President Biden,"" he told Fox News.DeFazio said House Democrats aren't going to keep rubber-stamping deals they don't like.""All through this administration, the White House has been a spear carrier for the president,"" he said.Obama rejected claims that he betrayed Democrats by cutting a deal with Republicans.But House Democrats are not listening.""So far, the response has not been very good,"" Pelosi said.",center

"At a ceremony honoring veterans and senior citizens who sent presents to soldiers overseas, Attorney General Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut rose and spoke of an earlier time in his life.“We have learned something important since the days that I served in Vietnam,” Mr. Blumenthal said to the group gathered in Norwalk in March 2008.There was one problem: Mr. Blumenthal, a Democrat now running for the United States Senate, never served in Vietnam.The deferments allowed Mr. Blumenthal to complete his studies at Harvard; pursue a graduate fellowship in England; serve as a special assistant to The Washington Post’s publisher, Katharine Graham; and ultimately take a job in the Nixon White House.In 1970, with his last deferment in jeopardy, he landed a coveted spot in the Marine Reserve, which virtually guaranteed that he would not be sent to Vietnam.Many politicians have faced questions over their decisions during the Vietnam War, and Mr. Blumenthal, who is seeking the seat being vacated by Senator Christopher J. Dodd, is not alone in staying out of the war.But what is striking about Mr. Blumenthal’s record is the contrast between the many steps he took that allowed him to avoid Vietnam, and the misleading way he often speaks about that period of his life now, especially when he is speaking at veterans’ ceremonies or other patriotic events.Sometimes his remarks have been plainly untrue, as in his speech to the group in Norwalk.In an interview on Monday, the attorney general said that he had misspoken about his service during the Norwalk event and might have misspoken on other occasions.But an examination of his remarks at the ceremonies shows that he does not volunteer that his service never took him overseas.In 2003, he addressed a rally in Bridgeport, where about 100 military families gathered to express support for American troops overseas.At a 2008 ceremony in front of the Veterans War Memorial Building in Shelton, he praised the audience for paying tribute to troops fighting abroad, noting that America had not always done so.“I served during the Vietnam era,” he said.Mr. Blumenthal, 64, is known as a brilliant lawyer who likes to argue cases in court and uses language with power and precision.But the way he speaks about his military service has led to confusion and frequent mischaracterizations of his biography in his home state newspapers.The New Haven Register on July 20, 2006, described him as “a veteran of the Vietnam War,” and on April 6, 2007, said that the attorney general had “served in the Marines in Vietnam.”And the idea that he served in Vietnam has become such an accepted part of his public biography that when a national outlet, Slate magazine, produced a profile of Mr. Blumenthal in 2000, it said he had “enlisted in the Marines rather than duck the Vietnam draft.”It does not appear that Mr. Blumenthal ever sought to correct those mistakes.In the interview, he said he was not certain whether he had seen the stories or whether any steps had been taken to point out the inaccuracies.“I don’t know if we tried to do so or not,” he said.He said he had tried to stick to a consistent way of describing his military experience: that he served as a member of the United State Marine Corps Reserve during the Vietnam era.Asked about the Bridgeport rally, when he told the crowd, “When we returned, we saw nothing like this,” Mr. Blumenthal said he did not recall the event.",conservative
"Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid broke with President Obama Monday over the proposed mosque near Ground Zero, saying the controversial Islamic center should be built elsewhere.Spokesman Jim Manley said in a written statement that Republicans should show their sincerity about sensitivity to Sept. 11 survivors by backing a high-profile bill to grant health benefits to rescue workers, something that stalled in Congress earlier this month.But at the same time, Manley put Reid on the record for the first time in the hyper-sensitive and volatile mosque debate.""The First Amendment protects freedom of religion,"" Manley said.Reid's comments added another high-profile voice to the mosque controversy.The prolonged presidential explanation elevated the issue beyond a local dispute and hurled it into the political arena.The White House claimed Monday that politics were not at play in Obama's decision to dive into the controversy over a planned mosque near Ground Zero.Burton said that he ""can't speak to the politics of what the Republicans are doing,"" but the president was not looking to make political hay with his remarks, which he reportedly considered carefully before delivering them at a White House dinner on Friday night.""The president didn't do this because of the politics.But the issue was quickly feeding fuel to Republicans looking to corner Democrats into taking a position on the issue -- something they were able to avoid before the president spoke up.Though Reid is on the record, the National Republican Senatorial Committee on Monday targeted Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., for not speaking out on the issue.""It's a remarkable commentary on the most camera-friendly senator that he's more than happy to weigh-in on caffeinated malt beverages, but he won't take a public position on the construction of a mosque near Ground Zero,"" NRSC spokesman Brian Walsh said in a written statement.""It's time for Chuck Schumer to stand up and be counted -- does he stand with President Obama in support of this mosque or does he stand with the countless 9/11 families who believe its location is inappropriate?"" Walsh asked.Walsh also suggested Reid would suffer politically from his allegiance to Obama on other issues, despite his stance on the mosque.""While it's commendable that Senator Reid now agrees with Republican Sharron Angle that we should respect the wishes of 9/11 families, it's regrettable that he hasn't demonstrated this same independence from President Obama on the critical issues facing America during the last 19 months,"" he said.Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., who opposes the mosque project, said Monday that the White House softened Obama's original comments because it probably heard ""pushback"" from other Democrats.""Everyone says as far as I know that the Muslim community has the right to build a mosque.Most Americans think the group planning the mosque and Islamic cultural center has the right to build it, according to a Fox News poll released Friday.Supporters of the mosque and cultural center in lower Manhattan, including New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, say its development should stand as a testament to religious tolerance in America.Burton said Monday that the president weighed in as part of a constitutional discussion.""The president thinks that it's his obligation to speak out when ... issues of the Constitution arise.He added the administration can't control the conversation on cable TV or in newspapers, but the White House has had a ""pretty fulsome conversation"" about it and has addressed it to a ""pretty full extent.""""I think that it's a debate that was had and we've weighed in,"" Burton said.",conservative
"RNC Chairman Michael Steele is expected by some to announce that he will not seek a second term as the head of the Republican National Committee, according to multiple reports.Politico reported over the weekend that many of his supporters as well as other GOP operatives believe that a Steele run was looking increasingly doubtful, due in part to the fact that he ""has built no known reelection team or structure, making the prospect of a campaign unlikely in the face of competition that grows fiercer by the day.""Meanwhile, multiple sources tell Fox News that they believe Steele will drop out of the race.And while many predict that Steele will call it quits after his current term, his increasing seclusion and detachment from other Republican advisers has made his forthcoming decision difficult to ascertain.Hotline On Call says the nature of the decision is a ""closely guarded secret"" and reports that ""even his top advisors, both inside and outside the committee, say they don't know which direction he will take.""Steele's gaffe-prone tenure at the helm of the RNC has aided the creation of a significant bloc of GOPers who are intent on seeing his departure next month.Maria Cino, a former Bush official who recently received key backing from former RNC Chairman Ed Gillespie and former Vice President Dick Cheney, became the latest official contender this weekend.Wisconsin GOP Chairman Reince Preibus, recently resigned RNC political director Gentry Collins, former U.S. ambassador Ann Wagner and former Michigan GOP chairman Saul Anuzis also round out the list.",liberal
"Senior White House officials significantly raised the stakes on congressional Democrats in their efforts to get a deal passed on the Bush tax cuts, warning on Wednesday that inaction would ""significantly increase the risk"" of a double dip recession.It wasn't quite the metaphorical flare of mushroom cloud imagery, but outgoing senior economic adviser Larry Summers offered a fairly dire assessment of the stakes in the tax cut debate.""If they [Democrats] don't pass this bill in the next couple weeks it will materially increase the risk that the economy would stall out and we would have a double dip,"" he told a gathering of reporters at an off camera briefing.A double dip recession?""What I said it would significantly increase the risk,"" Summers replied.The message was hardly subtle. But it certainly was debatable.Asked whether the country would find itself dipping towards the economic doldrums if Congress waited a month or two to get a tax cut package passed, Rob Shapiro, a former commerce official in the Clinton White House and a proponent of the current tax cut deal, offered more sober-minded analysis.""The wait would not cause a double dip,"" he said.Stabilizing the housing market, however, is not on the current congressional docket.There were few carrots to go along with the sticks.If anything, the pitch being offered from the administration to the rest of the party was: take the package now or risk being blamed for an economic downturn.""I guess the question back for those who ask [why not fight for more] is where does this go, what is the end game and what are the consequences of playing it?"" said senior adviser David Axelrod.Added Gibbs: ""I think you would really have to ask somebody who says... lets have some eight week fight and on February the 15th come in and say, alright, now we are ready to make a compromise, who on earth, who on earth thinks that that is somehow going to be a fundamentally better agreement than the one we are looking at right now?",center
"Several prominent conservatives offered swift, negative reactions to Michael Steele on Friday, after the RNC chairman was caught on camera saying that Afghanistan is a largely unwinnable war of President Obama’s choosing. The pushback crested with Bill Kristol — still an influential voice among Republican lawmakers — writing a letter to Steele on his Weekly Standard site calling for the RNC leader’s resignation.“Needless to say, the war in Afghanistan was not “a war of Obama’s choosing.”And not on a trivial matter.There are, of course, those who think we should pull out of Afghanistan, and they’re certainly entitled to make their case.Kristol’s was the harshest of all the reactions to the Steele, whose spokesman, it should be noted, tried to clarify the comment by insisting that he merely meant that President Obama has not been forthcoming with a winning strategy. But the Weekly Standard editor was not alone.Another major neoconservative figure, Dan Senor, told the Huffington Post that Steele’s comments are “utterly irresponsible.”Indeed, even Steele himself declared back in December that Afghanistan is “’a war we have to win” — a far cry from the comments he made Thursday night, in which he said: “...you don’t do is engage in a land war in Afghanistan, alright, because everyone who’s tried over a thousand years of history has failed.” “It’s completely inconsistent with this latest statement,” summarized Senor. In a bit of irony, Steele’s most recent comments have actually resonated among anti-war Democrats who share the skepticism that Afghanistan is a winnable enterprise.But Steele is not an anti-war Democrat. Nor is he a pundit.",center
"Every Senate Republican has signed onto a letter vowing to block all Democratic-backed legislation until the chamber extends the Bush tax cuts and approves a spending bill to keep the government running, Fox News has learned.Throwing down the gauntlet, all 42 members of the GOP caucus are sending the letter to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid warning him that they will bring matters to a standstill unless he swiftly brings those tax-and-spending issues to the floor.That means putting on the backburner a push to repeal the military's policy banning gays from serving openly in the military, a bill giving illegal immigrant students and military members a pathway to legal status and an extension of long-term unemployment benefits.""While there are other items that might ultimately be worthy of the Senate's attention, we cannot agree to prioritize any matters above the critical issues of funding the government and preventing a job-killing tax hike,"" they wrote. ""This strategy is very cynical but very obvious and transparent,"" he said in a statement.A panel of administration officials and bipartisan lawmakers is getting to work Wednesday to try to hash out a compromise over what to do about the expiring Bush tax cuts. President Obama met with top GOP and Democratic congressional leaders Tuesday but left the nitty-gritty negotiations to the panel -- he assigned Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and budget director Jacob Lew to represent the administration. ""We have full confidence we're going to be able to handle all of this very well,"" he said.But with Republicans vowing to deprive Democrats of the 60 votes they need to move toward a vote on virtually anything until these issues are addressed, negotiators will have to move quickly if they want to get to other matters before a new, more Republican Congress is sworn in next month.The administration is still looking to repeal the military's ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy after the Pentagon issued a report Tuesday claiming the policy shift would not harm the military in the long-run.Democrats also want to extend long-term jobless benefits, which expired Tuesday. The lame-duck Congress so far has approved a food safety bill, which still needs a final vote in the House, and a $4.5 billion settlement payment to black farmers and American Indians who claimed they were discriminated against by the U.S. Departments of Agriculture and Interior.Lawmakers also passed a one-month extension of the ""doc fix"" that prevents cuts to Medicare approved 15 years ago from going into effect, but without action the rates paid to doctors for treating those insured by the entitlement program will plummet on Jan. 1.It's not just Republicans who are concerned about the way the lame-duck session became a dumping ground for campaign promises and wish-list legislation.Aside from the tax rates, lawmakers must pass this week a continuing resolution to keep the government functioning. The filibuster threat increases pressure on the White House to offer a more realistic agenda for the remaining weeks of the year. ",center

"President Obama’s chief of staff used former President Bill Clinton as an intermediary to see if Representative Joe Sestak would drop out of Pennsylvania’s Democratic Senate primary if given a prominent, but unpaid, advisory position, the White House said on Friday.Rahm Emanuel, the chief of staff, asked Mr. Clinton last summer to explore “options of service” on a presidential or senior government advisory board with Mr. Sestak, the White House said in a statement.The White House disputed Republican claims that the conversations might be illegal or improper.Mr. Bauer went on to say that such horse-trading has been commonplace through history.Representative Darrell Issa of California, the senior Republican on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said the interactions described by the White House “represent an illegal quid pro quo,” even if the position was unpaid.Federal law makes it a crime for anyone “who directly or indirectly, promises any employment, position, compensation, contract, appointment, or any other benefit” to someone else “as consideration, favor, or reward for any political activity or for the support of or opposition to any candidate or any political party in connection with any general or special election to any political office.”While many have speculated that the White House offered to appoint Mr. Sestak as secretary of the Navy, Mr. Bauer said that was never the case.The White House did not disclose what those options were, but people briefed on the matter said one option was an appointment to the president’s Intelligence Advisory Board, a panel of prominent Americans outside government who provide independent oversight of the nation’s spy apparatus and advise the president.In a statement Friday, Mr. Sestak said Mr. Clinton had conveyed Mr. Emanuel’s suggestion that he join a “presidential board” while remaining in the House, but he declined.Mr. Sestak first mentioned publicly in February that he had been offered a job but provided no details, and the White House for three months had refused to discuss it, generating intense criticism from Republicans who accused it of trying to bribe a congressman and deep consternation among Democrats who called on the administration to answer questions.Mr. Emanuel was eager last summer to clear the way to this year’s Democratic Senate nomination for Mr. Specter, who had just left the Republican party, and to bolster Democrats’ majority in the Senate.In tapping Mr. Clinton as the go-between, Mr. Emanuel picked the party’s most prominent figure other than Mr. Obama and someone Mr. Sestak had worked for on the National Security Council in the 1990s.Mr. Clinton was at the White House on Thursday to have lunch with Mr. Obama and join him in greeting the American men’s World Cup soccer team heading to South Africa.As chief of staff and previously as chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Mr. Emanuel has not been shy about trying to steer party nominations to those he considers the stronger candidates.Whether that constitutes ordinary political horse-trading or crosses a legal line has been debated in Washington for months.Mr. Issa and all seven Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee have asked the Justice Department to appoint a special prosecutor.While declining to discuss what happened, Mr. Obama on Thursday said, “I can assure the public that nothing improper took place.”",conservative

"WASHINGTON — President Trump and Democratic congressional leaders dug in Wednesday for a lengthy partial shutdown in a newly divided government after a White House meeting — the first in 22 days — could not break an impasse over Mr. Trump’s demands for billions of dollars for a border wall.During the contentious meeting in the Situation Room, Mr. Trump made his case for a wall on the southwestern border and rejected Democrats’ proposals for reopening the government while the two sides ironed out their differences.“I would look foolish if I did that,” Mr. Trump responded after Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, posed the question to him directly, according to three officials familiar with the meeting who described it on the condition of anonymity.Democrats were equally adamant, according to another official who was present for the discussion.Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said after the meeting that he had no intention of putting Democratic bills to reopen the government to a vote if Mr. Trump would not sign them.“We’re hopeful that, somehow, in the coming days and weeks, we’ll be able to reach an agreement,” Mr. McConnell told reporters at the Capitol, offering an ominous timeline.The events underscored the personal and political crosscurrents standing in the way of any compromise between a president unwilling to lose face with his core supporters on his signature campaign promise and newly empowered Democrats — poised to assume control of the House on Thursday — who refuse to give ground on an issue that has come to symbolize Mr. Trump’s immigration policies.With the partial government funding lapse dragging into its 12th day and affecting 800,000 federal employees, the confrontation in the Situation Room only served to highlight the depth of the divide.“Could be a long time, or it could be quickly,” Mr. Trump said of resolving the shutdown.Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, who is in line to be elected speaker on Thursday, said: “We are asking the president to open up government. Why would he not do it?”“He could not give a good answer,” Mr. Schumer said.Mr. Trump tried creative ways to persuade the Democrats that they should support his wall.In her first legislative act as speaker, Ms. Pelosi plans on Thursday to bring up two bills to reopen the government.Mr. Trump’s rejection of those measures left the prospects of a resolution at their dimmest since the shutdown began on Dec. 22.The president asked the congressional leaders to return to the White House on Friday to continue the talks, after Democrats had completed their leadership elections, according to an official who attended the meeting.In a pair of evening tweets, Mr. Trump seemed to hold out hope of an agreement, writing: “I remain ready and willing to work with Democrats to pass a bill that secures our borders, supports the agents and officers on the ground, and keeps America Safe.But the path to such a deal is murky at best.Before he met congressional leaders on Wednesday, Mr. Trump publicly rejected a compromise that Mr. Pence floated privately with Democrats last month to stave off the government funding lapse, saying $2.5 billion in border security spending was insufficient.“No, not $2.5 billion, no — we’re asking for $5.6” billion, Mr. Trump said during a cabinet meeting, hours before the Situation Room briefing.His rejection of the figure seemed to confirm the concerns of Democratic leaders who had questioned whether they could trust senior White House officials to broker any compromise that could then be rejected by a president who has often shifted his position at the last moment, especially when it comes to immigration.The larger figure referred to the amount Mr. Trump has demanded for the wall, which the House endorsed in a vote last month, but which failed to garner even majority support in the Senate, where it would need 60 votes to prevail.But inside the Situation Room later on Wednesday, the proposal resurfaced and Mr. Trump appeared open to it, according to one of the officials present, as Mr. Pence and Mr. McCarthy pressed Democrats to meet in the middle.Wednesday’s gathering in the Situation Room, a secure chamber in the basement of the White House where military operations are tracked and other sensitive discussions unfold, was a conscious effort by Mr. Trump and his aides to infuse a sense of national-security crisis into the immigration discussion.But it quickly turned tense as Mr. Trump argued for his wall and called on Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, who appeared via teleconference from the border in San Diego to stress the need for it, according to two of the officials who were at the meeting.Mr. Schumer interjected, calling on Ms. Pelosi, who disputed Ms. Nielsen’s statistics, two of the officials said.The back and forth drew an angry response from the Department of Homeland Security.“Democrats in the room either don’t care that there is a humanitarian crisis on the border or just prefer ignorance,” Katie Waldman, a spokeswoman for the department, said in a statement on Wednesday night.Yet hours before the meeting began, what was billed as a somber security briefing had already taken on the sharp tone of a political showdown, as Mr. Trump charged that Democrats were sacrificing border security for a partisan advantage in the 2020 elections.“The United States needs a physical barrier,” the president said during the cabinet meeting, comparing the southern border to “a sieve” that allows criminals and drugs to enter the country and facilitates human trafficking.“Walls work,” he added, claiming inaccurately that former President Barack Obama has one “around his compound” in Washington.Mr. Trump repeated his false claims about the border wall, including that Mexico was already paying for it, as he promised during his campaign, and that much of its construction had already been completed.Outside the White House, the search for a way out is getting more urgent.Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, wrote an opinion article in The Washington Post suggesting three ways out: Grant the president the $1.6 billion for border security that he requested, without wall funding, plus an additional $1 billion for security at ports of entry; approve a bipartisan bill linking wall funding with protection for young immigrants brought illegally to the country as children; or resurrect the 2013 comprehensive immigration overhaul that included huge increases in border security measures, sweeping changes to immigration law and a pathway to citizenship for the nation’s 11 million undocumented immigrants.Incoming lawmakers vented new concerns about the shutdown’s effect.She noted that thousands of federal workers in her state were not receiving paychecks.",center
"WASHINGTON — President Trump declared a national emergency on the border with Mexico on Friday in order to access billions of dollars that Congress refused to give him to build a wall there, transforming a highly charged policy dispute into a confrontation over the separation of powers outlined in the Constitution.Trying to regain momentum after losing a grinding two-month battle with lawmakers over funding the wall, Mr. Trump asserted that the flow of drugs, criminals and illegal immigrants from Mexico constituted a profound threat to national security that justified unilateral action.“We’re going to confront the national security crisis on our southern border, and we’re going to do it one way or the other,” he said in a televised statement in the Rose Garden barely 13 hours after Congress passed a spending measure without the money he had sought.But with illegal border crossings already down and critics accusing him of manufacturing a crisis, he may have undercut his own argument that the border situation was so urgent that it required emergency action.The president’s decision incited instant condemnation from Democrats, who called it an unconstitutional abuse of his authority and vowed to try to overturn it with the support of Republicans who also objected to the move.“This is plainly a power grab by a disappointed president, who has gone outside the bounds of the law to try to get what he failed to achieve in the constitutional legislative process,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said in a joint statement.Mr. Trump’s announcement came during a freewheeling, 50-minute appearance in which he ping-ponged from topic to topic, touching on the economy, China trade talks and his coming summit meeting with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un.Sounding alternately defensive and aggrieved, Mr. Trump explained his failure to secure wall funding during his first two years in office when Republicans controlled both houses of Congress by saying, “I was a little new to the job.”Mr. Trump’s assertions were replete with misinformation and, when challenged by reporters, he refused to accept statistics produced by his own government that conflicted with his narrative.“The numbers that you gave are wrong,” he told one reporter.On point after point, the president insisted that he would be proved correct.Mr. Trump acknowledged that his declaration of a national emergency would be litigated in the courts and even predicted a rough road for his side.Indeed, Public Citizen, an advocacy group, filed suit by the end of the day on behalf of three Texas landowners whose property might be taken for a barrier.Among those predicting a flurry of judicial decisions against Mr. Trump was George T. Conway III, a conservative lawyer and the husband of Kellyanne Conway, the president’s counselor.The House Judiciary Committee announced Friday that it would investigate the president’s emergency claim, while House Democrats plan to introduce legislation to block it.The emergency declaration, according to White House officials, enables the president to divert $3.6 billion from military construction projects to the wall.Combined with $1.375 billion authorized for fencing in the spending package passed on Thursday night, Mr. Trump would have about $8 billion in all for barriers, significantly more than the $5.7 billion he unsuccessfully demanded from Congress.The president opted not to tap hurricane relief money from Texas or Puerto Rico, an idea that had generated angry complaints from Republicans.Neither the White House nor the Pentagon had yet identified which projects may be shelved as a result, but Pentagon lawyers and other officials planned to work over the weekend to identify which construction funds would be diverted.The declaration also provided that land may be transferred to the Defense Department from other federal agencies or from privately purchased or condemned land.Most Americans oppose Mr. Trump’s emergency declaration, according to polls.Mr. Trump’s desire for approval by Fox and other conservative news outlets was on display when he identified various pundits as supporters, naming Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham, Tucker Carlson and Rush Limbaugh, although he insisted that “they don’t decide policy.”But Ms. Coulter, who has viscerally attacked Mr. Trump for caving on the wall, has clearly gotten under his skin.Ms. Coulter fired back shortly afterward.White House officials rejected criticism from across the ideological spectrum that Mr. Trump was creating a precedent that future presidents could use to ignore the will of Congress.“It actually creates zero precedent,” Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, told reporters.Presidents have declared national emergencies under a 1970s-era law about five dozen times, and 31 of those prior emergencies remain active.White House officials cited only two times that such emergency declarations were used by presidents to spend money without legislative approval — once by President George Bush in 1990 during the run-up to the Persian Gulf war, and again by his son, President George W. Bush, in 2001 after the terrorist attacks in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania.In both of those cases, the presidents were responding to new events — the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and Al Qaeda’s assault on the United States — and were moving military funds around for a military purposes.In Mr. Trump’s case, he is defining a longstanding problem at the border as an emergency even though border apprehensions have actually fallen in recent years, to 400,000 in the last fiscal year from a peak of 1.6 million in the 2000 fiscal year.The spending package passed Thursday by Congress included none of the $5.7 billion that Mr. Trump demanded for 234 miles of steel wall.For weeks, Republicans led by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky urged Mr. Trump not to declare a national emergency, but the president opted to go ahead anyway to find a way out of the political corner he had put himself in with the failed effort to force Congress to finance the wall.Mr. McConnell privately told the president that he would support the move despite his own reservations, but warned Mr. Trump that he had about two weeks to win over critical Republicans to avoid having Congress vote to reject the declaration.Mr. Trump was among those Republicans who criticized President Barack Obama for using his executive authority to spare millions of illegal immigrants from deportation after failing to persuade Congress to do so.But Mr. Trump sought to drive home the personal toll of illegal immigration, inviting to the Rose Garden several relatives of Americans killed by people in the country without authorization.“Matthew’s death was preventable and should have been prevented,” one of the women, Maureen Maloney, said in an interview after the event.",liberal
"WASHINGTON — The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, revealed on Friday the most direct link yet between parallel efforts by the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks to damage Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election using Democratic Party material stolen by Russians.A top Trump campaign official dispatched Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime adviser to President Trump, to get information from WikiLeaks about the thousands of hacked Democratic emails, according to an indictment.The indictment made no mention of whether Mr. Trump played a role in the coordination, though Mr. Mueller did leave a curious clue about how high in the campaign the effort reached: A senior campaign official “was directed” by an unnamed person to contact Mr. Stone about additional WikiLeaks releases that might damage the Clinton campaign, according to the court document.In an indictment filled with colorful details about clandestine meetings, angry texts — even a reference to “The Godfather: Part II” — Mr. Stone was charged with seven counts, including obstruction, making false statements and witness tampering.F.B.I. agents arrested Mr. Stone before dawn, appearing at his Fort Lauderdale, Fla., home with ballistic vests and guns drawn.F.B.I. agents were also seen carting hard drives and other evidence from Mr. Stone’s apartment in Harlem, and his recording studio in South Florida was also raided.Mr. Stone appeared briefly on Friday morning in Federal District Court in Fort Lauderdale, his ankles and waist shackled in front of a packed courtroom.Afterward, in a theatrical appearance outside the courthouse, Mr. Stone vowed to beat what he called politically motivated charges.“I look forward to being fully and completely vindicated,” he added, then flashed twin V-for-victory hand signs reminiscent of his political hero, former President Richard M. Nixon.The indictment is the first in months by Mr. Mueller, who is investigating Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and possible coordination with Trump associates.According to the indictment, between June and July 2016, Mr. Stone told “senior Trump campaign officials” about the stolen emails in WikiLeaks’ possession that could be damaging to Mrs. Clinton.“A senior Trump campaign official was directed to contact Stone about any additional releases and what other damaging information Organization 1 had regarding the Clinton campaign,” the indictment said, referring to WikiLeaks.The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, sought to broadly distance Mr. Trump from the charges.A self-described dirty trickster, Mr. Stone began his career as a Nixon campaign aide and has a tattoo of Nixon on his back.He sometimes seemed to taunt American law enforcement agencies, daring them to find hard evidence to link him to Moscow’s interference; it is illegal for a political campaign to accept foreign aid.The indictment does not mention whether Mr. Stone or any other Trump associate knew about the Russian operatives’ plans before they hacked the Democrats.In social media posts and interviews during the 2016 presidential race, Mr. Stone indicated that he had advance knowledge that a trove of information damaging to Mrs. Clinton’s campaign might be about to spill into public view, and even suggested that he had personally spoken to the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange.Mr. Stone has changed his story as investigators closed in, saying that he was not actually speaking to Mr. Assange and that he had no direct knowledge that Russians were responsible for the Democratic hacking.Three senior Trump campaign officials told Mr. Mueller’s team that Mr. Stone created the impression that he was a conduit for inside information from WikiLeaks, according to people familiar with their witness interviews.In October 2016, Mr. Stone exchanged emails with Stephen K. Bannon, then the chief executive of Mr. Trump’s campaign.A day before Mr. Stone and Mr. Bannon emailed about WikiLeaks, Donald Trump Jr. exchanged messages on Twitter with the WikiLeaks account and asked, “What’s behind this Wednesday leak I keep reading about.”At the end of that week, on Oct. 7, WikiLeaks released more than 6,000 emails related to John D. Podesta, the chairman of the Clinton campaign.The special counsel’s investigators spent months encircling Mr. Stone, and the indictment unsealed on Friday detailed how he relied on several longtime associates to get information about the timing and content of WikiLeaks’ document releases in the months before the election.They pored over his testimony to the House Intelligence Committee, which is conducting its own investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.He exchanged heated texts with Randy Credico, a New York radio host with his own contacts with WikiLeaks, pressuring Mr. Credico to lie to the Intelligence Committee so that his story would line up with Mr. Stone’s.Mr. Stone told Mr. Credico he should “do a ‘Frank Pentangeli’” before the House committee, the indictment said, a reference to a “Godfather” character who lies to Congress about his interactions with the Mafia.The tumultuous relationship between Mr. Stone and Mr. Trump goes back decades, with Mr. Stone serving as an informal adviser as Mr. Trump considered running for president several times.When Mr. Trump formally announced during the spring of 2015 that he was running for president, Mr. Stone was one of the first to join his campaign.On Friday, the day that Mr. Stone stood on the steps of a courthouse and pledged his enduring loyalty to the president, Mr. Trump bashed the investigation that had led armed federal agents to his friend’s house in the morning darkness.“Greatest Witch Hunt in the History of our Country!” he wrote on Twitter. “NO COLLUSION!”",center
"President Trump said Friday that he will support a short-term spending bill to re-open the government, temporarily ending the partial government shutdown that has dragged on for more than a month -- despite a day earlier saying Republicans would not “cave” on his demands for funding for a wall on the southern border.“I am very proud to announce we have reached a deal to end the shutdown and reopen the federal government,” he said to applause from gathered Cabinet members.He said the deal would keep the government open for three weeks until Feb. 15 and that a bill would go before the Senate immediately. He made reference to his previous threats to declare a national emergency, calling it a “very powerful weapon,” but saying he didn’t want to use it. The deal appeared to include no money for a wall or steel barrier, but he said he hoped negotiations would continue to come to an agreement on wall funding.""Walls should not be controversial,"" he said.The shutdown was sparked by disagreement over President Trump’s demand for $5.7 billion in funding for a wall or steel barrier on the southern border. Democrats countered initially with $1.3 billion for general border security, while Trump said initially he would not sign anything without wall funding.In the last few weeks, the fight turned particularly nasty -- with Trump canceling a Democratic congressional trip to Afghanistan after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called on Trump to delay his State of the Union address or submit it in writing. Trump announced Thursday that he would delay the address, but if the government re-opens then it could take place on Tuesday as had been previously scheduled.After bills to re-open the government failed in the Senate Thursday, Trump signaled that a ""large down payment"" on funding, potentially less than the $5.7 billion, could be sufficient to end the stalemate. He suggested that a ""prorated down payment"" on the wall, without providing a concrete dollar figure, could be viable.Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., had also suggested that a three-week continuing resolution could be the way forward.""If they come to a reasonable agreement, I would support that,"" Trump told reporters.The partial closure of the government has led to hundreds of thousands of workers furloughed or working without pay, with groups representing the workers increasing their calls for D.C. to end the deadlock and get workers paid again. Many workers missed their second paycheck on Friday.Every former secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, including former White House chief of staff John Kelly, sent a letter to the president and Congress on Thursday asking them restore the department’s funding.“DHS employees who protect the traveling public, investigate and counter terrorism, and protect critical infrastructure should not have to rely on the charitable generosity of others for assistance in feeding their families and paying their bills while they steadfastly focus on the mission at hand,” the letter said. “This is unconscionable.”President Trump on Saturday announced a compromise plan that funded the wall while extending protections for 700,000 illegal immigrants brought to the country as children and 300,000 immigrants from countries designated unsafe to return. However, Democrats rejected the plan even before Trump announced it, and a Senate version of the plan failed to get the 60 votes needed on Thursday. A second bill, already passed by the Democrat-controlled House to re-open the government, also fell short.On Thursday, Trump had promised that Republicans “will not cave"" on border wall demands.",center
"Democrats’ landmark campaign finance, voting rights and ethics reform bill passed the House of Representatives on Friday.The For The People Act, which passed 234-193, was Democrats’ top priority upon winning control of the House in the 2018 elections.“This is a historic day, a pivotal day, a day that will make a difference,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said.The bill aims to answer rising attacks on voting rights from courts and politicians across the country, and also to stem the increasing inequality of campaign funding by empowering small donors with matching contributions from public funds, among many other things.The For The People Act “takes power from the elites, special interests and the 1 percent and gives it to the American people,” Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) said.“This vote is an opportunity to be on the right side of history,” Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) said.House passage of the legislation is the result of a long collaborative process by the Democratic Party to prioritize campaign finance and voting rights reforms.Much of this work was begun while Democrats languished in the House minority.One-hundred candidates, including those who won their 2018 races, signed a letter to Pelosi and other congressional leaders demanding the reforms be the first order of business.The vote broke down on party lines, with Republicans in hardened opposition.The Senate will not take up the bill, according to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).McConnell is perhaps the nation’s biggest opponent of campaign finance reforms, and the Republican Party has enacted measures across the country in the last decade to restrict voter access.Still, Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.) announced the outlines of a Senate companion bill on Wednesday.Democrats believe that the reform package is popular and plan to vote on individual pieces of it to keep the issues of corruption and voting rights front and center.The House bill “is just the first step in our efforts to change politics in this country ― to change politics in this town,” freshman Rep. Max Rose (D-N.Y.) said on Thursday ahead of the vote.“This is a fight that will not end until we win it,” Pelosi said.",liberal
"WASHINGTON — Impeachment was always going to hang heavily over a divided Washington.The episode began Thursday night, just hours after the 116th Congress was sworn in, when a camera captured Representative Rashida Tlaib of Michigan promising profanely to impeach Mr. Trump as she drew cheers from liberal activists at a celebration at a bar near the Capitol.Republicans, eager to portray Democrats as out to destroy Mr. Trump’s presidency, piled on criticism of Ms. Tlaib — some of it racially tinged.Perhaps out of a belief that an impeachment fight would help him politically — as it did President Bill Clinton in the 1990s — or outright fear that newly empowered Democrats actually might threaten his presidency, Mr. Trump dived into the conversation head first.“We even talked about that today,” he told reporters in the Rose Garden, referring to an exchange with Speaker Nancy Pelosi during a meeting earlier Friday to try to negotiate an end to the shutdown of the government, which Mr. Trump threatened to keep closed for years if he did not get money from Congress for a wall on the southern border.Senior aides to Ms. Pelosi and other Democrats in the room disputed that characterization.“In his opening comments at the meeting, President Trump brought up impeachment,” Ms. Pelosi’s spokesman, Drew Hammill, wrote on Twitter.Regardless, Mr. Trump’s frank embrace of the issue was another astonishing development: a president of the United States talking openly about his potential impeachment at a White House news conference.Earlier in the day, Mr. Trump had asked on Twitter, “How do you impeach a president who has won perhaps the greatest election of all time?Ms. Pelosi and senior Democrats said they were determined not to take the bait for now and risk generating a backlash from Mr. Trump’s supporters, who would most likely see impeachment as the overreaction of out-of-control Democrats.“People love you and you win,” Ms. Tlaib told the crowd Thursday night.She made no apologies for the remark on Friday, proclaiming that “I will always speak truth to power” and fashioning her own hashtag, #unapologeticallyme.Her outburst ran counter to all Democratic talking points.“I don’t really like that kind of language,” Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee — where any impeachment inquiry must begin — said on CNN.Ms. Pelosi defended Ms. Tlaib on Friday at a town hall hosted by MSNBC at the speaker’s alma mater in Washington, Trinity University.The Constitution grants the House the power to impeach executive branch officials for “treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors,” but what constitutes such crimes has traditionally been defined by the majority party of the House.Mr. Nadler, Ms. Pelosi and other party elders believe Mr. Trump is threatening the country’s democratic institutions.“We shouldn’t be impeaching for a political reason, and we shouldn’t avoid impeachment for a political reason,” Ms. Pelosi said.Republicans ignored the distinction.“Is this the behavior that we are going to find with this new majority party in Congress?” Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the Republican leader, asked at a news conference.Mr. Trump was similarly critical of Ms. Tlaib.“I thought her comments were disgraceful,” Mr. Trump said at the news conference.Ms. Tlaib is far from alone among House Democrats.“I continue to believe that obstruction of justice is the clearest, simplest and most provable high crime and misdemeanor committed by Donald J. Trump,” Mr. Sherman said in a statement.Many of Ms. Tlaib’s new colleagues expressed sympathy for her sentiments, even as they said the House should proceed differently.“Donald Trump is going to be impeached whether it is by the ballot box or Congress,” said Representative Eric Swalwell, Democrat of California and a member of the Intelligence Committee.But, Mr. Swalwell added, Democrats need to avoid making “a martyr” out of Mr. Trump by affording him “a fairer investigation than he deserves.”",center
"President Trump on Saturday said he appreciates FBI special counsel Robert Mueller releasing a statement disputing parts of a BuzzFeed news report claiming Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the timing of discussions over a proposed Trump Tower project in Moscow.“I thought that the BuzzFeed piece -- and maybe equally as bad the coverage of the BuzzFeed phony story -- it was a total phony story, and I appreciate the special counsel coming out with a statement last night, I think it was appropriate that they did so, I appreciate that,” he told reporters.""I think that the BuzzFeed piece was a disgrace to our country, it was a disgrace to journalism and I think also that the coverage by the mainstream media was disgraceful and I think it's going to take a longtime for the mainstream media to recover its credibility,"" he went on to say. ""It's lost tremendous credibility.""BuzzFeed published the story on Thursday, citing two law enforcement officials who said Cohen -- Trump’s former longtime attorney -- acknowledged to Mueller’s office that he was told to lie to Congress about the potential real-estate deal in Moscow, telling Congress that the negotiations ended months before they did so as to conceal Trump’s involvement.The article said that Cohen’s testimony “marks a significant new frontier: It is the first known example of Trump explicitly telling a subordinate to lie directly about his own dealings with Russia.”BuzzFeed also reported that Trump backed a plan, set up by Cohen, to visit Russia during the presidential campaign, meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in person and begin the negotiations.Mueller’s team is investigating alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election and rarely issues statements about the state of the investigation or disputing reports in the press.But on Friday, after Democrats had called for investigations and hinted at impeachment proceedings, the special counsel’s office took the extraordinary step of releasing a statement disputing the article.“BuzzFeed’s description of specific statements to the special counsel’s office, and characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office, regarding Michael Cohen’s Congressional testimony are not accurate,” Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller’s office, said. It did not offer further details about what it disputed.BuzzFeed’s editor in chief, Ben Smith, later tweeted that “we stand by our reporting and the sources who informed it, and we urge the Special Counsel to make clear what he’s disputing.”Trump’s team had also denied the claims in the article. Trump himself said Friday evening that the controversy was “a very sad day for journalism, but a great day for our country.”Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani on Friday also praised Mueller’s office for “correcting the Buzzfeed false story” and asked the press to take heed that their hysterical desire to destroy this President has gone too far.”In a statement Saturday aftternoon, BuzzFeed spokesman Matt Mittenthal doubled down on the organization's defense of its reporting.“As we’ve re-confirmed our reporting, we’ve seen no indication that any specific aspect of our story is inaccurate. We remain confident in what we’ve reported, and will share more as we are able,"" he said.",liberal
"President Trump said Friday he is declaring a national emergency on the southern border, tapping into executive powers in a bid to divert billions toward construction of a wall even as he signs a funding package that includes just $1.4 billion for border security.“We’re going to confront the national security crisis on our southern border … one way or the other, we have to do it,” Trump said in the Rose Garden.The move is expected to face a swift and forceful legal challenge that could stall the attempt in the courts for the near future.Trump, in the Rose Garden, declared once again that ""walls work"" as he confirmed the emergency declaration would accompany the spending legislation.""We’re talking about an invasion of our country,"" Trump said.And in an almost-casual tone, the president predicted a legal fight that will wind up before the Supreme Court.""We will have a national emergency, and we will then be sued,"" Trump said, adding that the federal appeals courts could well rule against his administration.A senior administration official told Fox News that the White House plans to move $8 billion in currently appropriated or available funds toward construction of the wall.That money includes about $600 million from the Treasury Department’s forfeiture fund.But by declaring an emergency, Trump would also seek to unlock money from the Defense Department’s military construction budget, to the tune of $3.5 billion.Diverting Pentagon funding, however, is expected to set off a legal battle and has already prompted fierce opposition from Democrats in Congress.""This is plainly a power grab by a disappointed President, who has gone outside the bounds of the law to try to get what he failed to achieve in the constitutional legislative process,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement.They vowed Congress would ""defend our constitutional authorities in the Congress, in the Courts, and in the public, using every remedy available.""""The President’s declaration of a national emergency would be an abuse of his constitutional oath and an affront to the separation of powers.This is far from the only declared national emergency.The president’s decision to declare a national emergency comes after a review of the spending package.The bill also imposed a number of restrictions on the White House, with legislative language preventing the administration from moving funding around to get a barrier or a wall -- a factor that may have contributed to the emergency declaration decision.The package, as it stands, is enough to build just 55 miles of barrier.The funding battle follows the longest government shutdown in U.S. history.The prior fight left little appetite on either side of the aisle for another shutdown, leading to the passage Thursday of the compromise measure.Trump, though, has talked for weeks about taking executive action to divert money from other programs for wall construction, without congressional sign-off—despite his criticisms of former President Barack Obama for using executive action.",conservative
"WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump’s partial government shutdown over his border wall closed in on the two-week mark and a brand-new Congress on Wednesday with no end in sight.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker-to-be Nancy Pelosi made their first visit to the White House since their Dec. 11 meeting with Trump, when he said he would be “proud” to take responsibility for a government shutdown in his effort to force Congress to spend billions of dollars on a wall along the southern border.“They are now feeling the heat,” Schumer said.Pelosi, who is expected to return to the House speakership Thursday afternoon after eight years as minority leader, intends as her first action to pass spending bills that won Republican support last year to reopen the closed agencies.“We’re asking the president to open the government,” she told reporters on the White House driveway.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, though, said he will not take up legislation that Trump has not endorsed, which means the shutdown will continue.About a quarter of the federal government ran out of operating money at midnight Dec. 21 after Trump reneged on his commitment to a sign a short-term spending bill that had already passed the Senate on a unanimous vote.Trump is now insisting that Congress appropriate $5.7 billion for that project, while Democrats want a short-term spending bill for the Department of Homeland Security and full-year funding for the other affected agencies while funding for the wall is negotiated separately.In the meantime, about 800,000 federal employees ― about half furloughed, half deemed “essential” and required to work anyway ― face real problems with their household finances.Trump, however, did not mention them during extended remarks he offered shortly before his meeting with the eight top Democratic and Republican congressional leaders.When asked how long the shutdown would last, the president replied, “As long as it takes,” calling his wall, a signature campaign promise, a matter of “national security.”Trump’s comments came at what was billed as the first Cabinet meeting of 2019.Trump’s remarks were riddled with falsehoods on everything from trade to the number of illegal immigrants in the country to the way NATO works.The White House did not respond to HuffPost queries about whether Trump understood that what he was saying was false and, if he did, why he was doing so anyway.Trump promised hundreds of times during his campaign that the wall would cost taxpayers nothing because he would get Mexico to pay for it.During the campaign, he promised a “great, great” wall made of reinforced concrete that would rise 30 feet or more and extend so far underground that it would be impossible to tunnel underneath.In a tweet Wednesday morning, Trump claimed, falsely, that Mexico was already paying for a border wall, thanks to a newly renegotiated trade deal, and that the wall was already largely done but he needed billions of dollars anyway.Despite numerous requests over several weeks, the White House has not provided any economic analysis to back up Trump’s claims.",center
"President Trump’s immigration compromise package to end the partial government shutdown drew sharp reactions from Democratic and Republican lawmakers alike.In a televised White House address on Saturday afternoon, Trump offered Democrats a three-year extension of protections for 700,000 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients, in exchange for the $5.7 billion he has been seeking for a barrier along the nation's southern border with Mexico.“Our immigration system should be a source of pride ... not a source of shame as it is all over the world,” Trump said in his plea.The president’s proposal was met with disdain from an array of top Democratic lawmakers.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., tweeted, “What we didn’t hear from the President was any sympathy for the federal workers who face so much uncertainty because of the chaos of the #TrumpShutdown.”Before Trump made his announcement, Pelosi had called his anticipated proposal “a non-starter.”“For one thing, this proposal does not include the permanent solution for the Dreamers and TPS recipients that our country needs and supports.”For his part, Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, called Trump's proposal ""one-sided and ineffective.""""It's clear the President realizes that by closing the government and hurting so many American workers and their families, he has put himself and the country in an untenable position.Schumer, D-N.Y., concluded, ""It was the President who single-handedly took away DACA and TPS protections in the first place – offering some protections back in exchange for the wall is not a compromise but more hostage taking.""House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer shared a similar sentiment, urging Trump and Sen. Mitch McConnell to ""stop holding government hostage and end the shutdown"" immediately.“The president must stop holding government hostage and end the shutdown so federal employees can get back to work serving the American people.Hoyer said negotiation can progress after the government reopens.“With the government open, we can negotiate an agreement to strengthen border security that both sides can support and that is in the best interests of the American people.”Another leading Dem, Sen. Kristen Gillibrand of New York, who announced her White House bid on Jan. 15 in an episode of ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,"" said Trump's offer was a ""bad deal.""Gillibrand tweeted: ""Trump ordered the end of DACA and TPS.Then there was New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez's response. He bluntly accused Trump of forcing ""a pointless shutdown"" to pay for the border wall.""This is about more than 800,000 Americans who are being held hostage by a President who has forced a pointless shutdown to pay for an expensive, ineffective wall.The Democratic senator also said ""a legitimate negotiation"" can proceed after the government is reopened.Fellow Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware slammed McConnell for refusing ""to meaningfully negotiate with Senate Democrats,"" but also called Trump's offer ""a first step toward comprehensive immigration reform.""""This senseless government shutdown is hurting millions of Americans, and its impacts are only getting worse. The President should re-open the government so that Republicans and Democrats in Congress can work with the White House to find a sensible solution on border security and immigration.""Some relief for Dreamers and an extension of Temporary Protected Status represent a first step toward comprehensive immigration reform, but more ideas from members of both parties should be taken up and debated.Republican lawmakers, at the opposite end of the reaction spectrum, praised the president for his willingness to negotiate.Senate Majority Leader McConnell, for instance, commended the president ""for taking bipartisan steps toward addressing current immigration issues.""In his statement, he said; “Compromise in divided government means that everyone can’t get everything they want every time.“This bill takes a bipartisan approach to re-opening the closed portions of the federal government.Republican Whip Steve Scalise called on Democrats to match Trump's willingness to negotiate.""The time for political games has long passed.Also on the Republican side, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said she was ""hopeful"" for a ""constructive debate"" with Democrats.“Compromise is not a sign of weakness — it’s a sign of strength, particularly when hundreds of thousands of families are being harmed.Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, whose views on the president and his policies have fluctuated, said Trump ""put forth a reasonable, good faith proposal that will reopen the government and help secure the border.""He tweeted, ""I look forward to voting for it and will work to encourage my Republican and Democratic colleagues to do the same.Earlier, while speaking in Ogden, Utah, Romney said he did not understand Pelosi's position on border security.""You (Pelosi) and your fellow Democrats have voted for over 600 miles of border fence in the past, why won't you vote for another few miles now? I don't understand their position, I really don't,"" the Republican senator said.Florida Sen. Marco Rubio took a positive view of Trump's proposed deal, like his fellow Republicans.“The way to end this shutdown is for both sides to make mutual concessions in order to reach an agreement.Likewise, House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy called the president's immigration offer ""reasonable.""McCarthy tweeted: ""President Trump has put forward a serious and reasonable offer to reform parts of our broken immigration system and reopen government.",liberal
"Democrats want access to special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election before President Donald Trump has a chance to interfere.In a joint letter from the chairs of six committees in the U.S. House of Representatives, Democrats wrote they expect Attorney General William Barr to make Mueller’s report public immediately.“After nearly two years of investigation — accompanied by two years of unprecedented attacks on the integrity of the investigation by President Trump — the public and Congress are entitled to know what the Special Counsel has found,” the letter urged.Its signatories include House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), oversight committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), intelligence committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.) and Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.)Earlier, Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) released a statement immediately after the Mueller report was revealed to be complete, demanding that Barr quickly put together a redacted, releasable version for Congress to access.Warner said in a statement: “Congress and the American people deserve to judge the facts for themselves.It is also critical that all documents related to the Special Counsel’s investigation be preserved and made available to the appropriate Congressional committees.He joined a number of other Democrats, including several 2020 presidential candidates, who either had statements prepared or tweeted about a prompt release.“The American people deserve to know the full truth about Russia’s interference in our democracy,” tweeted former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro.Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) said that the report should be released “without delay,” and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) released a joint statement in agreement.They, like Warner, didn’t want Trump to throw a wrench in Congress’ spokes by getting early access to the documents.“Attorney General Barr must not give President Trump, his lawyers or his staff any ‘sneak preview’ of Special Counsel Mueller’s findings or evidence, and the White House must not be allowed to interfere in decisions about what parts of those findings or evidence are made public,” the joint statement said.Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, echoed Trump’s own earlier call to release the report.Meanwhile, CNN reports that the “principal conclusion” of the report, which the attorney general will soon give to Congress, is expected to be made public.Trump’s camp wasn’t champing at the bit.“We’re pleased that the Office of Special Counsel has delivered its report to the Attorney General pursuant to the regulations.",center
"Every Republican on the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday demanded Rep. Adam Schiff step down as chairman over the California Democrat’s repeated claims to have evidence of Trump-Russia collusion.In a letter, obtained by Fox News and signed by every Republican on the committee, the lawmakers slammed Schiff for his claims in the media that there was “more than circumstantial evidence” of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.“Your actions both past and present are incompatible with your duty as Chairman of this Committee,” the letter stated.The letter follows the conclusion of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe, which turned up no evidence of collusion between Trump campaign members and Russia during the 2016 presidential election.President Trump himself went even further than congressional Republicans Thursday morning, tweeting:“Congressman Adam Schiff, who spent two years knowingly and unlawfully lying and leaking, should be forced to resign from Congress!”Another top Republican, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, also lambasted Schiff on Thursday - comparing the California lawmaker to director Oliver Stone.""He's made some pretty outrageous comments that Mueller could not verify, Graham said.Schiff, a vocal critic of the president, has doubled down on his claim that Trump and his administration colluded with foreign powers despite Mueller’s findings.“Undoubtedly, there is collusion,” Schiff told The Washington Post after Attorney General William Barr's four-page summary of Mueller's investigation was released Sunday.The letter to Schiff was sent as those same Republicans confronted Schiff at the start of a Russia-themed hearing Thursday morning.Rep. Michael Conaway, R-Texas, attacked Schiff for driving a “false narrative” about collusion between Trump and Russia and “undermining the faith” of the American people.Schiff defended himself during Thursday’s hearing – pointing to evidence of Russian hacking during the last presidential election, that Russian operatives offered dirt on Hillary Clinton during the campaign and that members of Trump’s campaign and family took meetings with Russians.“You might think that’s okay that they lied about the meeting,” Schiff said.Schiff on Monday signed a letter with his fellow House committee chairs demanding the full Mueller report by April 2.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said earlier this week that the mounting calls to remove Schiff were ""absolutely ridiculous.""A Pelosi aide said Schiff was being attacked because he's done ""an outstanding job.""""Democrats aren't going to be intimidated by the White House or Congressional Republicans,"" spokeswoman Ashley Etienne said.",liberal
"CHARLESTON, S.C. — Democratic presidential candidates wasted no time Friday evening demanding the immediate public release of the long-awaited report from Robert S. Mueller III, with several saying that Americans deserved to know any findings about President Trump, Russia and the 2016 election in order to form judgments about Mr. Trump and the 2020 race.Former Representative Beto O’Rourke, campaigning in South Carolina on Friday night, told reporters that “those facts, that truth, needs to be laid out for all Americans to be able to make informed decisions going forward, whether at the ballot box” or in their discussions with their senators and representatives.Mr. O’Rourke, asked if he supported impeaching Mr. Trump, said he believed the president and his 2016 campaign “at least sought to collude with the Russian government to undermine our democracy” and that Mr. Trump “sought to obstruct justice” once in office.“I think those are grounds enough for members of the House to bring up the issue of impeachment,” he said.No voters brought up the Mueller report to Mr. O’Rourke as he spoke to them Friday.Several candidates, in calling for the swift release of the report, also sought to gather new supporters and their email addresses by putting out “petitions” calling for complete transparency from the Justice Department.“The Trump Administration shouldn’t get to lock up Robert Mueller’s report and throw away the key,” Senator Cory Booker argued on Twitter, asking people to sign a petition and provide their names and emails.Within hours of Mr. Mueller’s completing his investigation, Senator Elizabeth Warren and the campaign arm of House Democrats were already placing ads on Facebook demanding the full report’s release, with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee seeking 100,000 signatures for its online petition.With no detailed information available about the report, Ms. Warren and Mr. Booker — as well as Senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Kamala Harris — sought to focus attention and pressure on how quickly Attorney General William P. Barr would release the full report.“Attorney General Barr — release the Mueller report to the American public. Now,” Ms. Warren wrote on Twitter.Ms. Gillibrand made similar demands and also retweeted the news of the report along with three words: “See you Sunday.”Ms. Harris, in addition to calling for the report to be released “immediately,” called on Mr. Barr to “publicly testify under oath about the investigation and its findings.”Ms. Harris, Ms. Warren and Ms. Gillibrand also joined Mr. Booker and Senator Bernie Sanders in asking supporters to sign their petitions calling for the report’s immediate release.Four other candidates — Senators Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington; former Representative John Delaney; and Julián Castro — also called for the release of the full report.“As Donald Trump said, ’Let it come out,’” Mr. Sanders wrote on Twitter.",center
"WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump’s offer to Democrats over the weekend seeking to trade temporary protections for some immigrants in exchange for funding for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border received positive coverage from some outlets, including being called a “compromise” and a move by Trump “toward the center.”But the latest details in the proposal, which Senate Republicans unveiled Monday in a bill they plan to vote on this week, make the offer appear less of a compromise and more of a wish list for immigration hard-liners like White House adviser Stephen Miller.Trump is offering a three-year extension for the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which protects from deportation hundreds of thousands of immigrants brought to the U.S. as kids.Democrats rejected the offer before Trump even announced it on Saturday, however, maintaining that it didn’t go nearly far enough and that the president ought to reopen the government before any negotiations over the border proceed.But the GOP bill incorporating his offer would also gut existing asylum laws for children and trafficking victims from Central America, ban asylum for minors who present themselves at ports of entry, gut the concept of temporary protected status for future cases and expand immigration detention ― all measures making it more likely to be dead on arrival in the Senate.“Given the poison pills stuffed into a proposal that was supposed to entice Democrats we can now say the Trump ‘offer’ isn’t about getting to a deal but about shifting blame.The bill would ban asylum for Central American minors, including those who arrive at the border with their parents, unless the minors apply for asylum in their home country.The administration has for months tried to reduce the number of people seeking asylum in the U.S. as part of a broader effort to stem the flow of Central American migrants crossing the border from Mexico.“This bill includes the most extreme changes on asylum that I’ve ever seen,” Kerri Talbot, the director of federal advocacy at the group Immigration Hub, said on a press call on Tuesday.Under the GOP bill, minors who apply for asylum would face much stiffer consequences for filing an application found to be frivolous ― including permanent ineligibility for future protections.The bill’s changes to asylum law alarmed immigration activists online, as well some on the right, including attorney and conservative writer Gabriel Malor.Trump’s efforts to win over Democratic support on the bill ― which will require at least 60 votes to pass in the Senate ― hit even more trouble on Tuesday after the Supreme Court once again did not act on the administration’s effort to end DACA.",center
"WASHINGTON — The House Intelligence Committee’s first hearing since Robert S. Mueller III completed his report had barely begun when the panel’s Republicans moved en masse to demand the resignation of the committee’s chairman.It went downhill from there.The acrimony on display Thursday as the intelligence committee tried to resume its work on Russia’s intervention in the 2016 presidential election laid bare the bitter divide that persists in Congress even after Mr. Mueller, the special counsel, completed his 22-month investigation of the subject.Representative Kevin McCarthy, the House Republican leader, spent much of his weekly news conference comparing Mr. Schiff, a fellow Californian, to Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, who fueled fears in the 1950s that Communist spies had infiltrated the American government.“With McCarthyism,” a senator was “chasing after Russian Communists,” Mr. Turner, an Intelligence Committee member, said.Undaunted, Mr. Schiff made clear he was not about to step down, nor was he about to absolve President Trump or his campaign from nefarious conduct with Moscow — especially without seeing Mr. Mueller’s report first.Mr. Schiff had many questions of his own.“You might think that it’s O.K. that the president’s son-in-law sought to establish a secret back channel of communications with the Russians through a Russian diplomatic facility.He continued: “You might think that it’s O.K. that the national security-designate secretly conferred with the Russian ambassador about undermining U.S. sanctions.Democrats who now control the House say that they will accept Mr. Mueller’s findings, but as Mr. Schiff’s monologue indicated they are increasingly determined not to let go of what they see as a deeply troubling pattern of wrongdoing by Mr. Trump, his businesses and his administration.That has in turn enraged Republicans, who have happily embraced what they call Mr. Mueller’s absolution of Mr. Trump.“The findings of the special counsel conclusively refute your past and present assertions and have exposed you as having abused your position to knowingly promote false information, having damaged the integrity of this committee, and undermined faith in U.S. government institutions,” Representative K. Michael Conaway, Republican of Texas, said to Mr. Schiff.Reading from a letter signed by every Republican member of the committee, Mr. Conaway added, “Your actions both past and present are incompatible with your duties as chairman of this committee.”Mr. Trump intervened as well, accusing Mr. Schiff of “knowingly and unlawfully lying and leaking.”Mr. Schiff, clearly prepared for the ambush, argued that there was a difference between prosecutors proving a criminal conspiracy and the committee investigating evidence of foreign compromise.Democrats backed him.Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California praised Mr. Schiff as “calm, professional, patriotic,” and said his work as the chairman of the committee has been “in stark contrast to the irresponsible and almost criminal behavior of the previous chair of the committee,” Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California.“What is the president afraid of — that he would go after a chairman of the committee?” she said.The party gave Mr. Schiff a more formal nod of confidence this week as well.Out of the glare of the television cameras, Democrats are somewhat more circumspect.“In the heat of the political moment just as the Republicans wanted to try to convict Hillary Clinton in the public sphere, Democrats probably contributed to the expectations that the outcome would be worse for the president than it was,” Mr. Himes said in an interview a day ahead of the hearing.Notably sitting out the fight was Mr. Nunes, whom Democrats have accused of many of the same abuses that Republicans accused Mr. Schiff of on Thursday and whose resignation they asked for last year.“We should not be used as a platform to spread false information and bizarre conspiracies,” Mr. Nunes said on Thursday in brief remarks before deferring to Mr. Conaway.Thursday’s showdown came, ironically enough, during a hearing with four subject experts on “Putin’s Playbook: The Kremlin’s Use of Oligarchs, Money and Intelligence in 2016 and Beyond.”“The bad news is that there is a new ideological fight between Putinism and the West, and it has only just begun,” said Michael McFaul, an ambassador to Moscow under former President Barack Obama.The whole episode offered a sharp contrast to the Senate Intelligence Committee, which with a yawning pace and no-leaks team has continued apace with its own Russia investigation.On Thursday, as Democrats and Republicans in the House traded recriminations, the Senate panel quietly called back for another interview with Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser.",center
"All nine Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee are calling on Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) to resign as its chairman over his public comments about the Russia investigation, which did not determine that President Donald Trump or anyone on his campaign conspired with Russia to win the 2016 election.Schiff has maintained his strong belief that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia, after the nearly two-year probe came to an end last week without directly implicating the president.“Undoubtedly there is collusion,” Schiff told The Washington Post on Tuesday.In a letter dated Thursday, the GOP committee members accused Schiff of standing “at the center of a well-orchestrated media campaign” about a possible Trump-Russia connection.“Your willingness to continue to promote a demonstrably false narrative is alarming,” they said, joining other top Republican lawmakers demanding Schiff’s ouster.Trump himself called on Schiff to resign Thursday in an early-morning tweet that accused the chairman of “unlawfully lying and leaking” information.Somewhat misleadingly, the GOP committee members stated in their letter that Mueller’s findings “conclusively refute” Schiff’s “past and present assertions” about the investigation.Questions about what the full report uncovered are still at the forefront of many Democrats’ minds, and the party is uniformly calling for the Justice Department to release it publicly.The Intelligence Committee Republicans’ letter concluded, “Your actions both past and present are incompatible with your duty as Chairman of this Committee, which alone in the House of Representatives has the obligation and authority to provide effective oversight of the U.S. intelligence community.”Schiff, in response to his critics, doubled down on his questions about the special counsel’s investigation, which indicted more than 30 people ― including several close to Trump.“I don’t think it’s OK,” he said Thursday.",center
"WASHINGTON — President Trump, facing a growing public backlash over the partial government shutdown, shifted course on Saturday and offered Democrats a deal: temporary protections for roughly 700,000 young undocumented immigrants in exchange for $5.7 billion in funding for a wall along the southern border.But the proposal, which Mr. Trump unveiled in a 13-minute address from the White House, appeared dead on arrival in the Capitol.With the shutdown entering its fifth week and polls showing a majority of the public blaming Mr. Trump, the president’s advisers have been searching for an exit strategy.The proposal was Mr. Trump’s first public offer to Democrats since the partial shutdown began nearly a month ago.In casting the plan as a compromise, the president sought to shift pressure to Democrats — who have repeatedly refused to give Mr. Trump any money for his border wall — to end the shutdown.Over the course of his administration, Mr. Trump has repeatedly sought to curb both legal and illegal immigration.In the deal he outlined on Saturday, Mr. Trump offered to restore T.P.S. protection for 300,000 people, and said he would allow 700,000 Dreamers to keep their protections for three more years in exchange for $5.7 billion for a border barrier.“That is our plan,” Mr. Trump said.The speech was the second time during the shutdown that the president addressed the nation about the immigration crisis.He paired the address with his first naturalization ceremony at the White House, a move intended to underscore the idea that he supports legal immigration.Calling the wall “a powerful and beautifully designed see-through steel barrier on our southern border,” Mr. Trump said: “This is not a 2,000-mile concrete structure from sea to sea.Mr. Trump noted that he had adopted some Democratic proposals on border security.In her talking points, issued to Democrats, Ms. Pelosi said her party favored “new drug, weapons and contraband scanning technology at official ports of entry,” and “filling the more than 3,000 vacancies for customs officers.”Even so, Democrats roundly criticized the president’s plan.“I think it’s simply more fake promises raising false hopes,” Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, said.Some on the right also pushed back, describing the proposal as amnesty.Mr. Pence, briefing reporters after Mr. Trump’s remarks, said the speech reflected a painstaking process of listening to lawmakers, including rank-and-file Democrats who made it clear they believed that protections for DACA and T.P.S. recipients must be included in a border security deal.And he pushed back forcefully against critics like Mr. Carafano who said the measure amounted to an unacceptable amnesty for undocumented immigrants.“There is no pathway to citizenship in this proposal,” Mr. Pence said.But that was one reason many Democrats considered it unacceptable.Noting that Tuesday is the deadline for the government to reopen in time to prevent federal employees from going a second consecutive pay period without a check, Mick Mulvaney, the acting chief of staff, said Senate Democrats had a tricky decision to make.Now it will be up to Mr. McConnell to put legislation incorporating Mr. Trump’s proposal on the Senate floor.Mr. McConnell — who has insisted he will not put any legislation on the floor unless the president will sign it — spoke to Mr. Trump, Mr. Kushner and Mr. Pence on Thursday night about finding a way forward.Mr. McConnell told the president that before he could bring up legislation on the Senate floor, he needed a “public reassurance” that Mr. Trump would sign it, one person close to the talks said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive discussions.The president’s proposal “strikes a fair compromise by incorporating priorities from both sides of the aisle,” Mr. McConnell said in a statement after Mr. Trump’s speech.If Mr. McConnell does indeed put a bill on the floor, as the president said he would, Senate Democrats will have to decide whether to block it or let it come up for a vote.The shutdown stalemate is creating increasing nervousness on Capitol Hill, especially among Republicans seeking re-election in Democratic-leaning states.On Saturday, she praised the president, saying she hoped that Mr. Trump’s offer would “lead to constructive debate that will end this impasse.”White House aides and allies of Mr. Trump said Saturday that Mr. Trump succeeded in ratcheting up the political pressure on Ms. Pelosi, especially if the Senate succeeded in passing a bill.“The Democrats’ talking points have been that the president is solely responsible for shutting down the government,” Marc Short, the former White House legislative director, said.But one reason Democrats are so leery of the deal is that they have been down this road with the president before.The standoff over the shutdown, some former aides noted, was the first time Mr. Trump has had to engage in meaningful, high-stakes negotiations.",liberal
"The 2020 Democratic presidential candidates may have faced a setback after Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation found no evidence of Trump-Russia collusion, but made clear that they're not giving up the hunt for incriminating details against the president.Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, campaigning in San Francisco on Sunday, told the large crowd that, “I don't want a summary of the report!And on Saturday, one day before Attorney General William Barr released a short summary of Mueller’s findings, former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke charged on the campaign trail in South Carolina that you “have a president, who in my opinion beyond the shadow of a doubt, sought to, however ham-handedly, collude with the Russian government ― a foreign power ― to undermine and influence our elections.”He did not comment at length on Sunday, but did say at a campaign stop in Las Vegas that Trump is “one of the most racist and uncivil presidents we have ever had.”Mueller’s nearly two-year-long investigation did not establish that members of Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government to interfere in the election in favor of Trump and at the expense of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.Mueller’s long-awaited findings also did not take a clear position on whether Trump obstructed justice, with no conclusions that the president committed a crime but also not exonerating Trump.America Rising, a pro-Republican opposition research group, took aim at O’Rourke, saying on Sunday after Barr’s announcement that the candidate made “brazen and incorrect claims on the campaign trail.”Barr is expected to make public more of the report, but 2020 Democrats are demanding the full report be released.“The Mueller report needs to be made public, the underlying investigative materials should be handed over to Congress, and Barr must testify.Rourke demanded Barr “release the full Mueller report to the American people and their representatives.""Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts pointed to a recent unanimous vote by Democrats and Republicans in the House of Representatives to urge the release of the report.“Congress didn’t ask for a 'summary,' Attorney General Barr.Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey wrote that the “American public deserves the full report and findings from the Mueller investigation immediately—not just the in-house summary from a Trump Administration official.”It was a similar call from Sen.

"President Donald Trump on Friday declared a national emergency at the southern U.S. border in an effort to unilaterally seize funding to begin building his long-promised wall between the U.S. and Mexico.Trump, who was accompanied by parents of children killed by unauthorized immigrants, said he was declaring the national emergency for “virtual invasion purposes.”But he also acknowledged another reason: He didn’t want to wait on Congress to approve the funds.“I could do the wall over a longer period of time ― I didn’t need to do this,” Trump said in a televised speech, even as he contended the situation on the southern border amounted to a national emergency.Trump is also expected to approve Congress’ spending bill, which grants him $1.375 billion for the wall, as opposed to the $5.7 billion he initially demanded.To justify the wall, Trump repeatedly insisted criminals, gang members and drug traffickers were pouring over the border and that only a wall could stop them.“We have far more people trying to get into our country today than probably ever before,” Trump said.In fact, arrests for illegal border crossings are at their lowest levels since the 1970s.The total wall funding will now come to about $8 billion, partially approved by Congress but mostly by Trump alone.The national emergency declaration will allow the Trump administration to use about $3.6 billion from Defense Department construction projects to build the wall, along with another $2.5 billion the department had allocated for counter-drug activities, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney told reporters.The Trump administration also plans to take executive action to move about $200 million from the Department of Homeland Security and another $600 million from the Treasury Department’s asset forfeiture account.None of the money will come from hurricane relief, Mulvaney said.The DHS funding bill included restrictions on where new border wall could be constructed.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) announced Thursday on the Senate floor that Trump planned to sign the bill and declare a national emergency at the same time, adding that he supported the decision.McConnell warned Trump in private that declaring an emergency would spark a backlash among Republicans, according to The Washington Post.A national emergency declaration grants a president the ability to circumvent certain government rules so that an administration can respond to a crisis.Administration officials cited dozens of previous national emergency declarations, insisting that Trump would not break with historical precedent by “unlocking” new pots of money for the border wall he seeks.“It’s not as if he just didn’t get what he wanted so he’s waving a magic wand and taking a bunch of money,” Mulvaney said.The move is almost certain to be challenged in court.“Any crisis on our border is of President Trump’s own making: family separations, child detention, turning our backs on asylum seekers, and more.Prior to the declaration, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called the proclamation a “gross abuse of the power of the presidency” and vowed that “Congress will defend our constitutional authorities.”For two months, Democrats in Congress have been enmeshed in stalled negotiations with Trump as he refused to accept anything less than $5.7 billion in the federal budget for his border wall.Trump reopened the government for three weeks on Jan. 25, allowing government workers to get back to work as border security negotiations continued.In January, Trump asserted that he had “the absolute right to declare a national emergency,” according to CNN.",center
"Roger Stone, an eccentric longtime Republican strategist with a tattoo of Richard Nixon’s face on his back, was arrested early Friday on criminal charges that include obstruction of an official proceeding, false statements and witness tampering.A federal grand jury impaneled by special counsel Robert Mueller charged Stone in a seven-count indictment.CNN shared footage of FBI agents arriving at the property:Kristin Davis, the former Manhattan madam, reportedly told The Washington Post’s Manuel Roig-Franzia that FBI agents also executed a search warrant at the New York City apartment she shared with Stone.Stone ― who worked on presidential campaigns for Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole and others ― took credit for Donald Trump’s presidential run and served as an informal adviser after he left Trump’s campaign in August 2015.He repeatedly has said it was “a possibility” that he would be indicted in Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and possible Trump campaign collusion.Stone has previously admitted to being in contact with Julian Assange of WikiLeaks during the Trump campaign.The indictment alleges he spoke “to senior Trump Campaign officials” about WikiLeaks and “information it might have had that would be damaging” to the campaign of Trump’s Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, in the summer before the election.Stone was “contacted by senior Trump Campaign officials to inquire about future releases” by WikiLeaks, according to the indictment, which refers to WikiLeaks as “Organization 1.”Stone’s attorney, Grant Smith, said in a statement that “there was no Russian collusion” and that the charges were “a clear attempt at silencing Roger.”After appearing in court on Friday, Stone said he plans to plead not guilty to the charges, saying he was “falsely accused” and calling the investigation “politically motivated.”“I look forward to being fully and completely vindicated,” he said, while onlookers booed.He also affirmed that he does not plan to testify against Trump, but would not say if he seeks a pardon from the president.The July 2018 indictment of 12 Russian intelligence officers in connection with the hack of a Democratic National Committee server during the 2016 election referred to Stone as “a person who was in regular contact with senior members of the presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump.”Stone has described his contact with the Russians ― who used the handle “Guccifer 2.0” ― as “benign.”Stone’s indictment came after his associate Randy Credico, a radio show host, testified before the grand jury.Stone, according to the indictment, “on multiple occasions” around Dec. 1, 2017, told Credico (“Person 2”) that he should “do a ‘Frank Pentangeli’” in his testimony before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence “to avoid contradicting Stone’s testimony.”It was a reference to the “Frankie Five Angels” character from “The Godather: Part II,” whom the indictment alleges Stone and Credico had previously discussed.",liberal
"WASHINGTON — President Trump agreed on Friday to reopen the federal government for three weeks while negotiations continued over how to secure the nation’s southwestern border, backing down after a monthlong standoff failed to force Democrats to give him billions of dollars for his long-promised wall.The president’s concession paved the way for the House and the Senate to both pass a stopgap spending bill by voice vote.The plan includes none of the money for the wall that Mr. Trump had demanded and was essentially the same approach that he rejected at the end of December and that Democrats have advocated since, meaning he won nothing concrete during the impasse.Mr. Trump presented the agreement with congressional leaders as a victory anyway, and indicated in a speech in the Rose Garden that his cease-fire may only be temporary: If Republicans and Democrats cannot reach agreement on wall money by the February deadline, he said that he was ready to renew the confrontation or declare a national emergency to bypass Congress altogether.“We really have no choice but to build a powerful wall or steel barrier,” Mr. Trump said.But Mr. Trump has already adopted some of the language that his Democratic adversaries have used during the longest shutdown in history.The surprise announcement was a remarkable surrender for a president who made the wall his nonnegotiable condition for reopening the government and a centerpiece of his political platform.“Good news for George Herbert Walker Bush: As of today, he is no longer the biggest wimp ever to serve as President of the United States,” the commentator Ann Coulter, who has aggressively pushed Mr. Trump to keep his campaign promise on the wall, wrote on Twitter.On Capitol Hill, though, jittery lawmakers from both parties greeted the news with relief.“None of us are willing to go through this again,” said Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, referring to a half-dozen Republicans who voted on Thursday for a Democratic measure to reopen the government for two weeks.Democrats, who declined to revel in their clear victory, said they would work in good faith to strike a deal on border security.But Speaker Nancy Pelosi stated plainly that any compromise would not include money for a new border wall, which Democrats view as ineffective and overly costly even though many have supported border fencing in the past.“Have I not been clear on a wall?” Ms. Pelosi said at a news conference with Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader.The cease-fire should pave the way for Mr. Trump to deliver his State of the Union address to Congress after all, but Ms. Pelosi said it would not be held this Tuesday, as originally scheduled.“The State of the Union is not planned now,” Ms. Pelosi said.As he announced the deal, Mr. Trump paid tribute to the federal workers who have endured five weeks without pay, expressing sympathy for them in a way he had not until now.He promised to ensure that workers would be compensated for the paychecks they have missed since the shutdown began in late December “very quickly or as soon as possible.”But other costs will be more permanent.According to an analysis from Standard & Poor’s, the ratings agency, the United States economy lost at least $6 billion in the five weeks the government was partly shuttered — more than the $5.7 billion that Mr. Trump had requested to build a steel or concrete barrier at the border.Mr. Trump offered no explanation for his surrender, nor did he acknowledge that it was one.During the president’s speech earlier in the day, cabinet officials and White House aides lined the sides of the Rose Garden and applauded him.Few lawmakers even in the president’s own party saw it that way.“I hail from a state that is very supportive of the president and border security with barriers, so that is a consideration for me, but there are a lot of other strategies we could employ that would work better” than a shutdown, said Senator Shelley Moore Capito, Republican of West Virginia.With polls showing the president enduring most of the blame by the public, Republicans led by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, pressured Mr. Trump to agree to the temporary truce.The president’s concession came a day after two competing measures to reopen the government failed on the Senate floor.Mr. McConnell and Mr. Schumer huddled on Thursday night after the failed votes to discuss a path forward.Mr. McConnell, who viewed the shutdown as unnecessary from the start, found Mr. Trump eager to end the impasse, and in a series of calls, they ironed out the details.As late as early Friday morning, Mr. Trump appeared intent on declaring a national emergency at the border alongside the agreement to reopen the government, but Mr. McConnell and White House officials encouraged him to drop the idea, according to people familiar with the discussions who were not authorized to discuss them.Republican leaders tried to rally their members during a closed policy luncheon before Thursday’s votes.Republican senators rose one by one to voice concerns about the effect on federal workers and the lack of forward momentum in an impasse that felt unbearable.“We’ve already lost,” lamented Senator Johnny Isakson, Republican of Georgia, according to people familiar with the remarks.At another point, during an exchange first reported by The Washington Post, Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, vented at Mr. McConnell for putting Republicans in the position of having to vote on two competing approaches to reopen the government — one Republican and one Democratic — without consulting them first.“You put us in this position,” Mr. Johnson said, according to one of his aides.Mr. McConnell, who had largely been absent from negotiations to reopen the government until late last week, responded, “Are you suggesting I’m enjoying this?”",conservative
"The House of Representatives on Friday approved a sweeping election reform bill that serves as the touchstone to the House Democratic agenda but has been criticized by civil libertarians and Republicans over First Amendment concerns.The so-called “HR 1” measure embraced by House Democrats aims to curb big money in politics, make it easier to vote and bolster election security.The House approved the plan 234-193.The American Civil Liberties Union, in a recent letter to Congress, encouraged lawmakers to vote against the bill because of “provisions that unconstitutionally impinge on the free speech rights of American citizens and public interest organizations.”“They will have the effect of harming our public discourse by silencing necessary voices that would otherwise speak out about the public issues of the day,” the ACLU wrote.One concern of civil libertarians is the bill’s inclusion of the DISCLOSE ACT, which would require all organizations that spend money on elections to disclose donors.The ACLU said it supports making organizations report spending for public communications like TV ads that expressly call for the election or defeat of a candidate for office, but it worries the DISCLOSE ACT goes beyond that.“These standards are unclear and entirely subjective, which will lead to confusion and, ultimately, less speech,” the ACLU said.Republicans called the bill a Democratic power grab that amounts to a federal takeover of elections.“Now, instead of getting money out of politics, the Democrats on this committee voted to pass a bill that will publicly fund – campaign travel, campaign dinners, and in some cases, the politicians themselves,” Illinois Rep. Rodney Davis wrote in an op-ed for The Hill.The White House said in a statement that the Democrats' plan would ""micromanage"" elections that now are run largely by states and would establish ""costly and unnecessary program to finance political campaigns.""But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the bill ""restores the people's faith that government works for the public interest, the people's interest, not the special interests.""Trying to turn Republicans' words against them, Pelosi said, ""Yes it is a power grab -- a power grab on behalf of the people.""House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy of California said the legislation would undermine the integrity of elections by allowing convicted felons to vote, and would apply a one-size-fits-all standard to elections now run by states and local governments.Democrats called that a mischaracterization.To Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., the bill ""grabs power away from the elites and the power brokers and gives it to the people.""She and other Democrats disputed the claim that taxpayers will pay for campaigns, noting that money for political campaigns would come from a surcharge on federal settlements made with banks and corporations that run afoul of the law.",center
"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez took a stand for fellow House freshman Rep. Rashida Tlaib on Saturday after the latter’s expletive-laced comments in favor of impeaching President Trump.Ocasio-Cortez, the Democratic socialist lawmaker from New York, went on Twitter to weigh in, accusing the GOP of a having a double standard.“Republican hypocrisy at its finest: saying that Trump admitting to sexual assault on tape is just ‘locker room talk,’ but scandalizing themselves into faux-outrage when my sis says a curse word in a bar,” Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. The lawmaker was apparently referring to a 2005 video that came to light ahead of the 2016 presidential election, in which Trump – talking to Billy Bush – made lewd comments about women.Trump issued an apology at the time and described the contents of the ""Access Hollywood"" recording as “locker room banter.” “I said it, I was wrong, and I apologize,"" Trump said.On Saturday, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted a vow to support Tlaib, D-Mich.“I got your back @RashidaTlaib - the Bronx and Detroit ride together,” she tweeted.Tlaib, who was sworn in as a new member of the 116th Congress on Thursday, was videotaped that night vowing to impeach the president -- shortly after she penned an op-ed for The Detroit Free Press outlining the case for impeachment.“People love you and you win,” the video showed Tlaib telling supporters. House Republicans fumed over the comments on Friday, with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., prodding Speaker Nancy Pelosi to act.Yet Pelosi, D-Calif., downplayed Tlaib’s remarks, expressing distaste for the language but suggesting that Trump’s own language had started the heated rhetoric in Washington.“I probably have a generational reaction to it,” Pelosi said at an MSNBC town hall. In the Rose Garden on Friday, Trump said he found Tlaib’s comments “disgraceful” and thought she “dishonored herself” as well as “her family.”Tlaib, doubling down on her comments, tweeted on Friday that she “will always speak truth to power. #unapologeticallyMe.”“This is not just about Donald Trump. This is about all of us. In the face of this constitutional crisis, we must rise,” she tweeted.",liberal
"WASHINGTON — The special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election disputed on Friday a report that said President Trump had directed Michael D. Cohen, his longtime lawyer and fixer, to lie to Congress about his role in negotiations to build a skyscraper in Moscow.The rare public statement by a spokesman for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, challenged the facts of an article published by BuzzFeed News on Thursday saying that Mr. Cohen had told prosecutors about being pressured by the president before his congressional testimony.“BuzzFeed’s description of specific statements to the special counsel’s office, and characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office, regarding Michael Cohen’s congressional testimony are not accurate,” said the spokesman, Peter Carr.Before Mr. Carr’s statement, the BuzzFeed report led to a flurry of reactions by senior members of Congress who said that the allegations, if true, could be grounds for initiating impeachment proceedings against Mr. Trump.The president himself responded on Twitter late Friday, calling the special counsel’s statement “a very sad day for journalism, but a great day for our Country!”A proven effort by Mr. Trump to pressure a witness to commit perjury would be one of the most damning revelations so far in the investigation into Russia’s attempts to sabotage the 2016 presidential election and could be the cornerstone of a case that the president obstructed justice to keep investigators at bay.Both the White House and lawyers for Mr. Trump vigorously denied the BuzzFeed report even before the special counsel’s office weighed in.“Two words sum it up better than anything anybody else can say, and that is ’categorically false,’” the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, told reporters on Friday.BuzzFeed News maintained that its report was accurate, its editor, Ben Smith, said after Mr. Mueller’s office disputed the account.The statement by Mr. Carr, the special counsel’s spokesman, was unusual because it appeared to be the first time he had publicly challenged the facts of a news media account that had generated significant attention for its revelations about the president.The New York Times has not independently confirmed the BuzzFeed report.Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said that his panel would investigate the BuzzFeed report and was “already working to secure additional witness testimony and documents related to the Trump Tower Moscow deal and other investigative matters.”If true, Mr. Schiff said, the allegations “would constitute both the subornation of perjury as well as obstruction of justice.”Representative Joaquin Castro of Texas, another Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee, wrote in a tweet that “if the @BuzzFeed story is true, President Trump must resign or be impeached.”Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told reporters on Friday that the panel expected Mr. Cohen to be back to testify privately in early February.The report added another jolt to a chaotic week for the White House, which has had to fend off questions about recent revelations that F.B.I. counterintelligence agents began investigating Mr. Trump in 2017 and that Mr. Trump has tried to conceal the details from senior administration officials about his interactions with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.In a December court filing, prosecutors working for Mr. Mueller described how Mr. Cohen had repeatedly lied to Congress both about the length of negotiations over the Trump Tower Moscow deal and about Mr. Trump’s involvement in the project.Mr. Cohen had told lawmakers that the negotiations ended in January 2016 — before the first presidential primaries — and were never discussed extensively among executives of the Trump Organization.They also said Mr. Cohen discussed the progress of the Moscow project with Mr. Trump more frequently than he had told the committee and had briefed members of Mr. Trump’s family about the negotiations.When he appeared in court to plead guilty to lying to Congress, Mr. Cohen said he had concealed his interactions with Russian officials and the fact that he asked Mr. Trump to travel to Russia to promote the deal because he wanted to support Mr. Trump’s “political messaging.”That day, Mr. Trump defended his role in the Trump Tower Moscow discussions, brushing aside concerns that he was advancing his business interests at the time he was hoping to become president.Mr. Cohen drafted his statement to Congress in August 2017 along with Steven Ryan, his lawyer at the time, according to people familiar with how the testimony was put together.At least one of Mr. Trump’s personal lawyers saw Mr. Cohen’s congressional testimony before he delivered it in August and October 2017, according to people with knowledge of the discussions.Mr. Cohen initially repeated his false statements about the Moscow tower to prosecutors working for Mr. Mueller after he pleaded guilty in August to campaign finance violations and financial crimes.Mr. Cohen said he initially lied because he did not want to contradict his congressional testimony, prosecutors said.That truthfulness was a departure from Mr. Cohen’s pattern of deception throughout his professional life, according to a separate sentencing memo by federal prosecutors in New York, filed at the same time as Mr. Mueller’s.Mr. Cohen was sentenced in December to three years in prison for lying to Congress, campaign finance violations and financial crimes.During his nomination hearing this week to become attorney general, William P. Barr was asked if the president would have committed a crime if he had coached a witness to testify falsely — or not to testify at all.“Yes,” Mr. Barr said. “Under an obstruction statute, yes.”",conservative
"In a rare statement issued Friday night, special counsel Robert Mueller’s team disputed BuzzFeed’s explosive report Thursday that said President Donald Trump directed attorney Michael Cohen to lie to Congress.Peter Carr, a spokesman for the special counsel, told BuzzFeed that its “description” of statements to Mueller’s office, as well as the “characterization” of documents and testimony the office obtained, was inaccurate.“BuzzFeed’s description of specific statements to the Special Counsel’s Office, and characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office, regarding Michael Cohen’s Congressional testimony are not accurate,” Carr told BuzzFeed.The special counsel’s statement adds more confusion over what Mueller’s team knows in its ongoing investigation into President Donald Trump’s ties to Russia.Citing two federal law enforcement officials involved in the investigation, BuzzFeed’s Thursday night report claimed that Trump directed Cohen to lie about negotiations over a Trump Tower in Moscow.Mueller’s office, the report said, learned of Trump’s orders to Cohen “through interviews with multiple witnesses from the Trump Organization and internal company emails, text messages, and a cache of other documents.”According to BuzzFeed, “Cohen then acknowledged those instructions during his interviews with that office.”Responding to the statement from Mueller’s office on their report, BuzzFeed Editor-in-Chief Ben Smith said it stands by its reporting and asked the special counsel’s office to clarify its statement.“We stand by our reporting and the sources who informed it, and we urge the Special Counsel to make clear what he’s disputing,” Smith tweeted.In a follow-up statement on Saturday, a BuzzFeed spokesman told The New York Times that the news site had “re-confirmed” its reporting and seen “no indication that any specific aspect of our story is inaccurate.”The special counsel’s statement Friday homed in on the statements, documents and testimony that was obtained by Mueller, but it did not directly dispute that Trump had directed Cohen to lie to Congress, nor did it make mention of the Trump Tower deal in Moscow.BuzzFeed’s original reporting sent Democrats on Capitol Hill into a furor as it suggested that Trump may have obstructed justice, thus providing grounds for impeachment or criminal charges.In a strong statement issued Friday night, Sen. Dianne Feinstein joined a chorus of her Democratic colleagues in threatening serious action, including impeachment, against Trump if the allegations proved true.“We’ve previously known about attempts to develop Trump Tower Moscow and the misrepresentations surrounding those efforts,” Feinstein said.“Now, media reports say President Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about that business deal,” Feinstein continued.Earlier Friday, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) revealed that his committee had already begun searching for witnesses and documents to confirm BuzzFeed’s report. “Our committee is already working to secure additional witness testimony and documents related to the Trump Tower Moscow deal and other investigative matters,” Schiff said.“As a counterintelligence concern of the greatest magnitude, and given that these alleged efforts were intended to interfere with our investigation, our Committee is determined to get to the bottom of this and follow the evidence wherever it may lead,” he added.Trump has maintained he is innocent and on Friday accused Cohen of lying to the special counsel in order to reduce his jail time.",liberal
"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is not upset over Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib’s vulgar comment on impeaching President Donald Trump, said just hours after Thursday’s swearing-in ceremony on the House floor.Asked for her reaction to Tlaib’s “colorful language” ― the new Democratic congresswoman vowed to “impeach that motherfucker,” referring to Trump ― Pelosi said it was a free speech issue.“I probably have a generational reaction to it, but in any event I’m not in the censorship business,” she told MSNBC’s Joy Reid in a town hall interview set to air in full Friday evening.“I don’t like that language.“But I don’t think it’s any worse than what the president has said,” she concluded.Pelosi reasoned that while Trump’s comments have the power to “impact people’s lives,” the new congresswoman’s comments do not.Tlaib, who became one of the first Muslim women in Congress on Thursday, dropped the expletive as she spoke to a crowd of supporters at an event hosted by the progressive group MoveOn.Talking about her victory, she said: “And when your son looks at you and says, ‘Mama, look, you won.As she passed the microphone, the crowd erupted into cheers.Pelosi told Reid that the comment might fire up Trump’s base, but doesn’t actually make much of a difference to actual House business.Any controversy over Tlaib’s comment concerns the “freedom of speech of an individual member,” not the stance of the Democratic caucus, Pelosi said.Trump appeared to respond to Tlaib over Twitter Friday morning, writing: “They only want to impeach me because they know they can’t win in 2020, too much success!”",conservative
"WASHINGTON — The House passed the Democrats’ showcase anti-corruption and voting rights legislation on Friday, an expansive measure that aims to dismantle barriers to the ballot box, end big money in politics and impose stricter ethics rules on federal officials.The sweeping legislation, passed 234-193, makes good on the campaign pledge to clean up Washington that helped catapult Democrats into the majority.“It’s a power grab for the American people,” said Representative Zoe Lofgren of California, who leads the House administration committee that shepherded the legislation.The ambitious compendium, at nearly 700 pages, includes proposals designating Election Day as a federal holiday, automatically registering citizens to vote, and restoring voting rights to people who have served felony sentences.Republicans arguably have spent more time trying to define the bill — called the For the People Act or H.R. 1, to underscore its primacy — and tear it down than Democrats have spent trying to promote it.“This bill is a massive federal government takeover that would undermine the integrity of our elections,” Mr. McCarthy said in a speech on Friday, in an attack on “this new, Democrat, socialist majority.”Some of the most debated provisions are intended to reveal who funds online political ads and finances so-called dark-money groups.“Congress cannot meaningfully address the nation’s significant challenges without first recognizing and acknowledging the undue influence of special interests in our politics,” said Representative Abigail Spanberger, Democrat of Virginia.Some of those provisions, however, have drawn criticism from both conservative and liberal groups that argue the language is overly broad and would infringe on First Amendment rights.Democrats have also used the legislation to make clear that they believe that cleanup must start with the White House, and included several provisions jabbing at the president and homing in on a laundry list of his administration’s alleged ethical abuses.It would require presidents and vice presidents, as well as candidates for the nation’s highest offices, to release at least 10 years of federal tax returns — Mr. Trump has released none — and it stipulates that inaugural committees must disclose their expenditures.And an amendment sponsored by Representative Raul Ruiz of California would prohibit federal funds from being spent at businesses owned or controlled by the president, the vice president or any cabinet official.Two other measures also zero in on the costs of administration officials’ travel.“We must hold our government leaders to the highest standards, and with so many high-profile ethics violations in the past years, it is clear we have failed to do that,” Representative Tom O’Halleran, Democrat of Arizona and the sponsor of the amendments, said in a statement.Democrats also successfully put down an attempt by Republicans to divide the caucus and tar the legislation with a resolution expressing the sense that “allowing illegal immigrants the right to vote devalues the franchise and diminishes the voting power of United States citizens.”Republicans have repeatedly ambushed Democrats — twice successfully — with politically freighted procedural motions in a drive to divide Democrats and draw out vulnerable swing-district members.",conservative
"President Donald Trump announced Friday a short-term plan that will reopen the government for three weeks so that border security negotiations may continue without the devastating effects of the partial government shutdown.Trump said he’s prepared to sign a bill to open the government through Feb. 15.The announcement comes on the 35th day of the longest shutdown in United States history and is a clear cave by Trump, whose impasse over the budget stems from his demands for $5.7 billion in funds for his long-promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border ― a project Democratic lawmakers say is a firm deal-breaker.If funding for his border wall is not secured by the end of the negotiation period, Trump said he is prepared to shut down the government again or issue a national emergency declaration in order to get funding ― a plan that would strip funding from disaster recovery efforts.Throughout the shutdown, Trump’s reputation has suffered across parties as airports have grappled with severe delays and federal workers have gone without paychecks, putting many at risk of losing their homes, defaulting on loans and missing other crucial payments.Trump’s statement comes a day after the Senate failed to pass his proposal to reopen the government with border wall funding in exchange for temporary legal protection for some undocumented immigrants.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) was in the middle of a roundtable with Capitol Hill reporters when reports began surfacing of Trump’s support for a short-term government funding bill.“We’re going in that direction but we’re not to that place,” said Pelosi.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) spoke on the Senate floor shortly after Trump’s announcement, congratulating lawmakers on the development.“The solution to this impasse was to separate funding the government from our disagreements over border security,” Schumer said, adding that “we can never hold American workers hostage again.”Trump spent most of his speech on Friday rehashing his usual talking points about crime at the border.“We really have no choice but to build a powerful wall or a steel barrier,” he said.",conservative
"The FBI's pre-dawn arrest of President Trump's ex-adviser Roger Stone at his Florida home prompted critics to once again question the tactics of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, after more than a dozen special agents clad in tactical gear raided Stone's property Friday.Stone, 66, was taken into custody early Friday after being indicted by a federal grand jury a day earlier as part of Mueller’s investigation into Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates during the 2016 presidential election. CNN, which conveniently happened to be staking out Stone's Fort Lauderdale home, posted video of the arrest that showed a team of FBI agents with guns banging on Stone’s door and demanding that he come outside.“At the crack of dawn, 29 FBI agents arrived at my home with 17 vehicles, with lights flashing, when they could have contacted my lawyer,” Stone explained after a court appearance Friday. “But the FBI agents were extraordinarily courteous.”Stone will appear on Fox News Channel's ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" on Friday at 8 p.m. ET.Stone’s attorney added that the arrest was a “spectacle.”“A SWAT team, searching the house, scaring his wife, scaring his dogs—it was completely unnecessary,” Stone’s attorney said. “A telephone call would have done the job, and he would have appeared. Mr. Stone has nothing to hide.”The arrest operation drew scrutiny on social media—even from President Trump, who said “Border Coyotes, Drug Dealers and Human Traffickers are treated better,” and questioned “who alerted CNN to be there?”One federal law enforcement source told Fox News on Friday that the operation was “standard” for a home arrest. The source told Fox News that home arrests typically take place early in the morning with a team of FBI agents in protective gear, adding that Stone’s situation was “nothing out of the ordinary.”A former senior Justice Department official, now-white collar criminal attorney with Ifrah Law, James Trusty, told Fox News that while common procedure in white collar cases would involve a federal prosecutor contacting the defendant’s attorney, Stone’s charges could have sparked a different approach.“It shows that there is either a fundamental distrust of Mr. Stone, possibly due to the witness tampering charge, or that there was a real breakdown with his attorney,” Trusty said Friday. “The wild card here is that in charging Stone with a form of obstruction of justice, the Mueller team may view it differently than typical white-collar investigations.”He added: “If the FBI and the Mueller team believe Stone has engaged in witness tampering, then there is a palpable distrust, which would make them err on the side of surprise, rather than a courtesy phone call.”The 24-page indictment released early Friday alleges that Stone worked to obstruct the House Intelligence Committee’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election by making false statements to the committee, denying he had records sought by the committee and persuading a witness to provide false testimony.The indictment does not charge Stone with conspiring with WikiLeaks, the anti-secrecy website that published the emails, or with the Russian officers Mueller says hacked them. Instead, it accuses him of witness tampering, obstruction and false statements about his interactions related to WikiLeaks' release.But former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia Joseph diGenova blasted the tactic as “outrageous.”“I am appalled that the U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI have permitted a vindictive use of arrest in a non-violent case with a defendant who was willing to surrender,” diGenova, who has informally been an adviser to the president throughout the Russia investigation, told Fox News. “This is an abuse of power and it underscores the vindictive nature of it by the fact that CNN was alerted ahead of time.”He added: “For those of us who have been prosecutors and have prosecuted mob figures, drug dealers and terrorists—those are the people for whom these aggressive tactics are reserved. Not a Roger Stone.”“Make no mistake,” he said. “This was designed to be vindictive and intimidating.”DiGenova likened the FBI arrest of Stone to the bureau’s early morning raid last summer of the home of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.Stone on Friday said he would plead not guilty to the charges leveled against him by the special counsel’s team, and said he “looks forward to being fully and completely vindicated.”“I believe this is a politically motivated investigation,” Stone said Friday. “There is no circumstance whatsoever under which I will bear false witness against the president, nor will I make up lies.”Stone served as an adviser to Trump for years before Trump ran for president. He left Trump’s campaign in August 2015, but maintained regular contact with and publicly supported the Trump campaign throughout the 2016 presidential election.Mueller’s investigation, which was initially ordered to look into the 2016 election, has gone on for more than a year and half. It has expanded to probe financial crimes of Trump associates before the election, conversations Trump’s national security adviser had with the Russians during the transition and whether Trump obstructed justice with his comments and actions related to the probe.Twenty-six Russian nationals and three Russian companies have been charged with interfering in the 2016 presidential election.

"President Trump stood firm Friday on his demands for a border wall after the second White House meeting with congressional leaders this week broke up with no apparent deal, warning Democrats the partial government shutdown could last ""years"" and saying he could even declare a ""national emergency"" to bypass Congress if necessary.“We can call a national emergency [to build a border wall] because of the security of our country,” Trump told reporters in the Rose Garden, during a lengthy and impromptu press conference.“I may do it,” he said, before adding, “If we can do it through a negotiated process, we’re giving it a shot.”The press conference underscored how far apart both sides are, even as Trump called the meeting ""productive"" and suggested the standoff could end soon -- or not. ""This is national security we’re talking about, we’re not talking about games,"" he told reporters. Despite Trump saying conversations had ""come a long way,"" Democrats were more dour in their assessment. Trump later confirmed in the Rose Garden, ""Absolutely I said that,"" while clarifying he hopes the partial shutdown doesn't last more than a few more days. ""Steel is more expensive than the concrete, but I feel like we’re talking about steel because the other side feels better about it,"" he said.Yet House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the Democrats' view is that they cannot resolve the funding dispute until the government fully opens. Looking for an elusive resolution, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Trump agreed to designate staff to engage in negotiations with congressional leadership aides this weekend. The meeting came on the 14th day of the shutdown, which was triggered by disagreements over the funding of Trump’s promised wall, after Democrats formally took control of the House of Representatives. Trump met with Democratic and Republican leaders of both chambers. “As we begin this new Congress, our first task should be to reopen the Government and to deliver on our highest duty as elected officials: the security of the Nation and its borders,"" he said. As part of his strategy, he made available to every member a presentation on border security that he said those present at a meeting Wednesday did not want to hear.“Americans have endured decades of broken promises on illegal immigration. Democrats, meanwhile, passed legislation in the House that would fund the whole government, but not the wall.  ""The wall and the government shutdown really have nothing to do with each other,"" Pelosi said at an MSNBC Town Hall.""There is no reason to have workers pay a price with their paycheck,"" she saidThe legislation was immediately dismissed by Republican leadership. “We need to make policy rather than simply making political theatre,” he told reporters.White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said on ""Fox & Friends"" earlier Friday that it would be up to Pelosi to get her party behind her, including the left flank pushing for impeachment.“We think we're hopeful because the people that elected Nancy Pelosi didn't elect her to come up here and do nothing and didn't elect her to play political games,” she said. On Thursday night, Pence said on Fox News' “Tucker Carlson Tonight” that the terms of the negotiations were clear: ""Bottom line, if there's no wall, there's no deal.""",center
"BERKELEY HEIGHTS, N.J. — President Trump said on Saturday that conservative voices were being unfairly censored on social media, hinting that he might intervene if his allies’ accounts continued to be shut down.“Social Media is totally discriminating against Republican/Conservative voices,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter, saying that “censorship is a very dangerous thing.”“Speaking loudly and clearly for the Trump Administration, we won’t let that happen,” he added.Social media companies, facing pressure from lawmakers and users over their role in the rise of misinformation and partisan division, have promised to step up their enforcement practices. After the content from Mr. Jones and his website, Infowars, was removed, he issued a plea to Mr. Trump to block the companies’ actions and “come out before the midterms and make the censorship the big issue.”In the same video appeal, Mr. Jones urged Mr. Trump to “point out that the communist Chinese have penetrated and infiltrated” the American election system and are “way, way worse than the Russians.”Minutes after his tweets on Saturday morning about social media, the president — who has long had an affinity for conspiracy theories — appeared to do just that.“All of the fools that are so focused on looking only at Russia should start also looking in another direction, China,” Mr. Trump wrote. Mr. Trump’s tweets on Saturday, sent from his golf club in Bedminster, N.J., were not the first time he has accused social media companies of discriminating against Republicans. Twitter has said that it does not shadow ban users, although it has struggled to define what its policies against hate speech are. Mr. Jones has had his posts and videos on his personal account and on Infowars severely restricted or removed by Apple, Facebook, Google and Spotify. In his tweets on Saturday, Mr. Trump urged social media companies to “let everybody participate, good & bad,” saying that while networks like CNN and MSNBC might be “fake news,” he does not “ask that their sick behavior be removed.”Yet Mr. Trump has waged relentless attacks on news coverage that he does not like, and has long expressed hostility toward traditional press freedoms.

"WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, whose experience and stability were widely seen as a balance to an unpredictable president, resigned Thursday in protest of President Trump’s decision to withdraw American forces from Syria and his rejection of international alliances.Mr. Mattis had repeatedly told friends and aides over recent months that he viewed his responsibility to protect the United States’ 1.3 million active-duty troops as worth the concessions necessary as defense secretary to a mercurial president.Officials said Mr. Mattis went to the White House with his resignation letter already written, but nonetheless made a last attempt at persuading the president to reverse his decision about Syria, which Mr. Trump announced on Wednesday over the objections of his senior advisers.Mr. Mattis, a retired four-star Marine general, was rebuffed.“My views on treating allies with respect and also being cleareyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held,” Mr. Mattis wrote.His resignation came as Congress appeared to be hurtling toward a government shutdown and as a deep market slump became even worse over fears of continuing government turmoil.With the ousting this month of John F. Kelly as White House chief of staff, Mr. Mattis was the last of Mr. Trump’s old-guard national security team — leaving policy in the hands of Mike Pompeo, the president’s second secretary of state, and John R. Bolton, the third White House national security adviser.Mr. Trump said that Mr. Mattis, 68, will leave at the end of February, and that Mr. Mattis “was a great help to me in getting allies and other countries to pay their share of military obligations.”The president said he would name a replacement soon.As Mr. Mattis was handing in his resignation, the Pentagon was preparing to draw down forces in Afghanistan.“This is scary,” Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a Twitter post.Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, called it “a sad day for America because Secretary Mattis was giving advice the President needs to hear.”He added that Mr. Mattis “rightly believes that Russia and China are clear adversaries and that we are at war with jihadists across the globe who plot to kill Americans at home.”Mr. Mattis’s resignation letter was the sharpest, and most public, protest from inside the Trump administration over the president’s rejection of the alliances and relationships that have underpinned American security since the end of World War II.It was also the first resignation over a major national security issue by a leading cabinet member since 1980, when Cyrus Vance quit as secretary of state.Mr. Mattis’s letter did not single out any decision.He said the core of American national interests lay in “providing effective leadership to our alliances,” and specifically described the importance of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a defense alliance Mr. Trump has often derided.But Mr. Mattis’s core complaint was that Mr. Trump had lost sight of the importance of the competition for global power with Russia and China, who want “a world consistent with their authoritarian model.”Mr. Mattis was the primary author of a new American defense strategy whose central goal was to take on “revisionist” powers — an approach that some of Mr. Trump’s former advisers say the president never fully comprehended.Mr. Trump’s decision to pull out of Syria, which was opposed by virtually every high-level administration official but lauded by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, was the last straw.No senior Pentagon official has defended the withdrawal publicly, despite requests from the White House.During Thursday’s meeting at the White House, officials said that Mr. Trump again asked Mr. Mattis to publicly endorse the Syria decision.The president’s tweets announcing the departure of his defense secretary shocked officials at the Pentagon, who as recently as Thursday afternoon were insisting that Mr. Mattis had no intention of resigning.Mr. Trump’s selection of Mr. Mattis as his Pentagon chief only weeks after his 2016 election was widely praised.Mr. Mattis commanded Marines in Afghanistan and in the 2003 invasion of Iraq before becoming the head of United States Central Command, overseeing all American troops in the Middle East.He favored working with allies, and often spoke of how difficult it was to conduct American policy without the benefit of friends.The relationship between Mr. Mattis and Mr. Trump had deteriorated for months.As defense secretary, Mr. Mattis oversaw the world’s most powerful military, supervising active-duty troops based in the United States and deployed worldwide, including in war zones in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and on the Saudi border with Yemen.As with Mr. Trump’s abrupt firing of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the split with Mr. Mattis was a full turn in a relationship that once appeared strong.In Mr. Mattis’s early days as defense secretary, he often ate dinner with the president in the White House residence.But Mr. Mattis also quietly slow-walked a number of Mr. Trump’s proposals, including banning transgender troops, starting  a Space Force and putting on a costly military parade.",liberal
"Police have arrested a suspect in connection with at least a dozen packages containing likely pipe bombs mailed in the past week to people critical of President Donald Trump.Cesar Sayoc, 56, of South Florida was taken into custody on Friday, FBI Director Chris Wray confirmed at a press conference.Sayoc has been charged with five federal crimes ― interstate transportation of an explosive, illegal mailing of explosives, making threats against former presidents and certain other persons, threatening interstate communications, and assaulting current and former federal officers ― the Department of Justice said.In remarks at the White House before a youth leadership summit, Trump congratulated local and national law enforcement agencies for apprehending the suspect.“We must never allow political violence to take root in America,” Trump said.“The bottom line is that Americans must unify,” he went on.Minutes after addressing the threats to prominent Democrats, Trump claimed Republicans are often attacked for supporting him.The development came hours after two additional packages were discovered, one addressed to Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), and the other to former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper.A suspicious package was also found Friday in Burlingame, California, addressed to Democratic donor Tom Steyer, CNN and NBC reported.“We’re thankful that everyone we work with at NextGen America and Need to Impeach is safe,” Steyer said in a statement Friday, referring to his super PAC NextGen and his campaign to impeach Trump.Authorities have heightened their search in Florida, as several of the packages may have passed through the state.Throughout the week, more than 10 packages containing potential explosive devices have been mailed to lawmakers and other public figures critical of Trump, including former President Barack Obama, former President Bill Clinton, Trump’s 2016 presidential opponent Hillary Clinton, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), actor Robert De Niro and former CIA Director John Brennan.The package addressed Brennan was sent to CNN’s New York City bureau, sparking an evacuation Wednesday.The Sacramento County Sheriff Department also said Friday that a suspicious package found at a Sacramento mail facility and addressed to Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) contained an explosive device.All of the confirmed packages listed the Florida office of Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), the former chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, as the return address.Asked why Sayoc appeared to be targeting Democratic politicians and others critical of Trump, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said he didn’t know but that the suspect “appears to be a partisan”Wray added: “It’s too early at this stage to discuss motive.”Investigators identified Sayoc based on a fingerprint found on the package sent to Waters and a DNA sample from a previous arrest in Florida, DOJ officials said Friday.When law enforcement arrested him on Friday in Plantation, Florida, they also took possession of a van covered in stickers supporting Trump and criticizing Democratic officials.Sayoc is a registered Republican and a self-described promoter and booking agent.A spokeswoman for Brevard College in North Carolina confirmed to HuffPost that Sayoc attended the school for three semesters starting in the fall of 1980 and did not graduate.Authorities were initially vague about the content of the packages, calling them simply “suspected explosive devices.”Wray noted that the investigation was ongoing and warned there could be other packages not yet intercepted.",conservative
"Federal authorities made an arrest on Friday in connection with the nationwide bombing campaign against outspoken critics of President Trump, a significant breakthrough in a case that has gripped the country in the days leading up to the midterm elections.A law enforcement official identified the suspect as Cesar Sayoc Jr., 56, of Aventura, Fla., just north of Miami.Mr. Sayoc, a registered Republican, has a lengthy criminal history in Florida dating back to 1991 that includes felony theft, drug and fraud charges, as well as being arrested and accused of threatening to use a bomb, public records show.His criminal record from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement indicates that at the time of his last arrest in 2015, he was 5-foot-11 and 215 pounds. According to a 2012 bankruptcy petition filed in Miami, Mr. Sayoc resided at the time at his mother’s home. On Friday morning, the authorities surrounded a white van with pro-Trump stickers on it, and television news later showed images of the authorities hauling the van away on a truck underneath a tarp. Some residents of Aventura reported seeing a similar white van covered in pro-Trump stickers often parked in the lot of a local strip mall, the Aventura Waterways shopping center. “It struck me because of the crazy conspiratorial stickers covering the windows,” said David Cypkin, a documentary film producer and editor with the Rakontur production company. Speaking at the White House on Friday, Mr. Trump praised law enforcement officials for quickly arresting a suspect.“These terrorizing acts are despicable and have no place in our country,” he said.He added: “We must never allow political violence to take root in America.”Mr. Sayoc’s arrest came only hours after the mysterious spate of pipe bombs spread further as federal authorities said on Friday morning that they had found two more of the explosive devices: one addressed to Senator Cory Booker and the other to James R. Clapper Jr., the former director of national intelligence.Although no formal charges have been filed yet in the case, two of the law enforcement officials said there was a high likelihood that Mr. Sayoc would be prosecuted at least in part in Federal District Court in Manhattan. The package addressed to Mr. Clapper was meant to be delivered to the New York offices of CNN, where he works as an analyst, but was intercepted at a mail facility in Midtown Manhattan, police officials in New York City said. At a news conference on Friday morning, John Miller, the New York Police Department’s deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism, said a postal worker at the mail facility on 52nd Street recognized the package addressed to Mr. Clapper as similar to other suspicious packages discovered this week and “froze it in the system.”The department’s bomb squad responded to the facility and secured the package for delivery to an F.B.I. lab in Quantico, Va., Mr. Miller said.Speaking on CNN on Friday, Mr. Clapper said he was not surprised that a device had been sent to him. “This is definitely domestic terrorism,” Mr. Clapper said. Mr. Clapper also said that on Wednesday night he had taken precautions after the first packages were discovered. All together, 12 crude explosive devices have been found since Monday, sent through the mail to a host of Democrats and other prominent figures who have been among Mr. Trump’s most vocal detractors. All of the envelopes had return address labels bearing the misspelled name of Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat whose district is in southern Florida. The first package was discovered on Monday afternoon at the suburban New York home of Mr. Soros. ",liberal
"President Donald Trump tweeted on Thursday that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, a retired Marine general who was one of Trump’s first Cabinet picks, would be retiring at the end of February.Mattis, who served more than four decades in the military and headed the U.S. Central Command from 2010 to 2013, won Senate confirmation as defense secretary on Jan. 20, 2017, shortly after Trump’s inauguration.The Pentagon chief, nicknamed “Mad Dog Mattis” during his time as a Marine, echoed Trump’s call for strengthening the military and beefing up its combat readiness.Mattis’ resignation letter addressed to Trump indicates his final day in office will be Feb. 28.“I am proud of the progress that has been made over the past two years on some of the key goals articulated in our National Defense Strategy: putting the Department on a more sound budgetary footing, improving readiness and lethality in our forces, and reforming the Department’s business practices for greater performance, he wrote.“Our troops continue to provide the capabilities needed to prevail in conflict and sustain strong U.S. global influence.”In the unusual letter, Mattis also wrote that he and Trump had differing views on Russian and Chinese authoritarianism: “Because you have the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position.”Earlier this week, Trump went against Mattis by abruptly withdrawing U.S. troops from Syria.News of Mattis’ departure comes in the wake of reports that the White House had been discussing who might replace him, a topic that was first reported by The Washington Post in early September.Some of the top names that were reportedly under consideration included four-star Army Gen. Jack Keane, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), former Treasury Department official David McCormick and former Republican Sen. Jim Talent of Missouri.Trump denied that he had been looking to replace Mattis, telling reporters that he was “very happy” with him.That assurance came ahead of the release of a book by acclaimed Watergate journalist Bob Woodward, which reported that Mattis once told staffers that Trump has the understanding of a “fifth- or sixth-grader.” Mattis has denied having said that.A major split between Trump and Mattis concerned Russian President Vladimir Putin.“[Putin’s] actions are designed not to challenge our arms at this point, but to undercut and compromise our belief in our ideals,” Mattis told U.S. Naval War College graduates at a commencement ceremony in June.Trump, in contrast, has praised Putin’s leadership skills and recently roiled U.S. allies by calling for Russia’s reinstatement to the Group of Seven major industrial nations.Mattis had also argued that the U.S. should consider staying in the Iran nuclear deal unless Tehran was found not to be abiding by the multi-nation agreement.Trump went on to pull out of the deal in May, claiming that it had been poorly negotiated during the Obama administration.Mattis opposed Trump’s proposed ban on transgender service members, as well as the use of torture in the interrogation of terrorist suspects.His most prominent moment in the public spotlight occurred in April when he handled briefings on Trump’s decision to conduct targeted airstrikes against Syria in response to the alleged use of chemical weapons by Assad’s regime in that nation’s civil war.Even then, Mattis’ recommendation that congressional approval be sought for the strikes put him at odds with the president.Mattis joins a growing list of high-profile departures from the administration.Reince Priebus lasted barely six months as White House chief of staff, and Sean Spicer had a similarly short tenure as press secretary.White House Communications Director Hope Hicks, a Trump aide before he won the presidency, announced her resignation in February.White House deputy chief of staff Joe Hagin, who also served in the Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush administrations, is expected to leave his post in July, Politico reported.",center

Sort of.Trump tweeted that “too many voices are being destroyed, some good and some bad, and that cannot be allowed to happen.” So, he added: “Let everybody participate, good & bad, and we will all just have to figure it out!”Trump accused social media giants of “closing down the opinions of many people on the RIGHT, while at the same time doing nothing to others.”“Censorship is a very dangerous thing & impossible to police,” he added, before embarking on a now familiar rant about “fake news” CNN and MSNBC — which he admitted to sometimes watching, but “just with a grain of salt.”Trump did not reference any person in particular in his tirade against the tech companies, although a host of them have in recent weeks banned conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his website Infowars from their platforms.",center
"Schumer bashed by the left over shutdown-ending dealSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer is taking heat from some of the most influential and deep-pocketed groups in the liberal base for caving to Republicans in the shutdown standoff.“Today’s cave by most Senate Democrats was … a stunning display of moral and political cowardice,"" said Democracy for America, just one of several such groups bashing Schumer for the stand-down on Monday.Schumer and fellow Senate Democrats forced the shutdown over the weekend after insisting that any temporary spending bill to keep the government fully operational include permanent protections for the so-called DREAMers -- immigrants brought illegally to the United States as children.The four-term New York senator and the dozens of other Democrats who initially voted Friday to block the spending bill had been lauded by their progressive base even as nearly 1 million federal workers were furloughed without pay.“Let the Senate know we stand with them for the Dreamers … say THANKS!Yet by the time Schumer said Monday afternoon on the Senate floor that Democrats would soon vote in support of ending the shutdown, in exchange for Republicans’ commitment to promptly craft and vote on legislation to help DREAMers, Schumer’s support had turned.“This deal was morally reprehensible and political malpractice.Democracy for America, the political action committee founded by former Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean, also said: ""If you want to know why we lost in 2016 and why a Democratic wave in 2018 is far from guaranteed … look no further than this weak and profoundly disappointing cave from Senate Democrats.”Members of the “No, DREAM, No Deal” began stepping up their calls for Schumer and others to “stand strong” Sunday night, when Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., suggested a compromise had been reached, without offering any solid commitment.“When the Democrat filibuster of the government funding bill ends, the serious, bipartisan negotiations that have been going on for months now to resolve our unfinished business -- military spending; disaster relief; healthcare; immigration and border security -- will continue,” he said.Schumer, near the time of his announcement Monday, pledged his continued support for DREAMers, tweeting: “Soon, the govt will reopen, and we have a lot to do: #ProtectDreamers.But by the time Republicans had the 60-plus votes, with support from 33 Democrats, the revolt was in full force.“Enough is enough,” said Lorella Praeli, director of immigration policy and campaigns at the American Civil Liberties Union.The short-term deal now only gives Congress until Feb. 8 to work out longer-term legislation, and an agreement on immigration.Trump tweeted Tuesday he's not sure it will happen.""Nobody knows for sure that the Republicans & Democrats will be able to reach a deal on DACA by February 8, but everyone will be trying....with a big additional focus put on Military Strength and Border Security.",liberal

"U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) and his wife, Margaret Hunter, were indicted Tuesday on charges of improperly using campaign funds for private use.A grand jury in San Diego indicted the Hunters on charges of filing false campaign finance records, saying the couple misused more than $250,000 after a two-year investigation.The indictment includes details accusing the Hunters of making efforts to hide their personal expenses, including labeling fees for dental work as a donation to a charity called “Smiles for Life” and tickets to see Riverdance as a fundraising event for “Republican women.”Hunter, 41, is a five-term congressman representing San Diego County who served for three tours in Afghanistan and Iraq as a Marine.Hunter had blamed his wife, who acted as a campaign manager, for many of the improper charges, saying she controlled the campaign’s credit card, and in February he feigned ignorance in an interview with Politico, saying: “Nah, I know the rules.”“And if I did” spend campaign funds improperly, he said, “it was an accident and I paid it back.”He repaid his campaign more than $60,000 earlier this year for improper expenses dating back to 2015, but the FBI began investigation additional charges dating back as far as 2009, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune.“The goal of the conspiracy was for Duncan Hunter and Margaret Hunter to enrich themselves, and others at their direction, by converting campaign funds for their own personal benefit and enjoyment,” the 47-page indictment says.In a speech earlier this month, Hunter echoed President Donald Trump and castigated the Justice Department, accusing the agency of being “corrupt, answerable to no one” and said it “uses the law to extort the American people and effect political change.”“I call on this Congress to root out all the corrupt lawyers and bureaucrats in the DOJ and the FBI so the greatest president of my generation can do the work that the American people duly elected him to do,” Hunter said.The lawmaker is running for re-election in November against Democrat Ammar Campa-Najjar.When HuffPost asked Hunter how his campaign was going at the end of July, just before House lawmakers left for the August break, Hunter said things were good.“I don’t think there’s a big wave right now,” Hunter said, referring to a wave of Democratic gains.“The Republicans left in California are pretty well-liked by their constituents,” he said.",conservative
"President Donald Trump said he’s considering an executive order to remove the right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S. to parents who aren’t citizens ― a right enshrined in the 14th Amendment that could likely be changed only through a constitutional amendment.Trump said in an interview with “Axios on HBO” taped Monday that he could execute the change via executive order.“It was always told to me that you needed a constitutional amendment.He said the right awarded to babies born as birthright Americans is “ridiculous” and that the system “has to end.”Trump also falsely stated that the U.S. is “the only country in the world” that offers citizenship to those born here.It’s not clear what the executive order would look like or when it would be proposed ― if Trump follows through at all, considering his tendency for pre-election bluster and warnings he has received from fellow Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan (Wis.), who have said doing so would be outside the bounds the president’s authority.All babies born in the U.S. are American citizens under the Constitution’s 14th Amendment, which cannot be changed by presidential order.Changing that policy would dramatically reshape the U.S. ― effectively punishing the children of undocumented immigrants, whom Trump has vowed to remove from the country.An executive order challenging birthright citizenship would ensure a legal battle, in which most experts think the president would fail.“The president cannot erase the Constitution with an executive order, and the 14th Amendment’s citizenship guarantee is clear,” said Omar Jadwat, director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project.Some Republicans ― including Ryan ― quickly shot down Trump’s idea.Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.) criticized the president’s statement, calling instead for immigration reform “that makes our country more secure and reaffirms our wonderful tradition as a nation of immigrants.”Another Republican, Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan, also tweeted that such an executive order would not be possible.The are some experts who disagree.Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) announced Tuesday that he would introduce legislation “along the same lines as the proposed executive order from President Trump” to end birthright citizenship, a policy change he has supported for years.“This policy is a magnet for illegal immigration, out of the mainstream of the developed world, and needs to come to an end,” Graham said in a statement on Tuesday.Trump has long supported ending birthright citizenship, recommending in 2015 on the campaign trail that the country “start a process” to scrap it.“I don’t think they have American citizenship and if you speak to some very, very good lawyers — and I know some will disagree — but many of them agree with me and you’re going to find they do not have American citizenship.The president has lasered in on immigration ahead of next week’s midterm elections, stoking fear about the caravan of migrants heading toward the U.S.-Mexico border from Central America.He deployed 5,200 active-duty troops to the border on Monday in what officials of his administration described as a necessary national security measure.",conservative
"President Trump said he was preparing an executive order that would nullify the long-accepted constitutional guarantee of birthright citizenship in the United States, his latest attention-grabbing maneuver days before midterm congressional elections as he has sought to activate his base by vowing to clamp down on immigrants and immigration.“We’re the only country in the world where a person comes in and has a baby, and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United States for 85 years, with all of those benefits,” Mr. Trump told Axios during an interview that was released in part on Tuesday, making a false claim.In fact, at least 30 other countries, including Canada, Mexico and many others in the Western Hemisphere, grant automatic birthright citizenship, according to a study by the Center for Immigration Studies, an organization that supports restricting immigration and whose work Mr. Trump’s advisers often cite.But Mr. Trump’s plan met with swift pushback from some even in his own party on Tuesday.“You obviously cannot do that,” Ryan told WVLK, a radio station in Lexington, Ky.Mr. Ryan compared the idea of doing so to Barack Obama’s 2012 action to grant work permits and deportation reprieves to some undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children, which Republicans, including Mr. Trump, vociferously protested as a naked abuse of presidential power.Doing away with birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants was an idea Mr. Trump pitched as a presidential candidate, but there is no clear indication that he would be able to do so unilaterally, and attempting to would be certain to prompt legal challenges.“We all cherish the language of the 14th Amendment, but the Supreme Court of the United States has never ruled on whether the language of the 14th Amendment — ’subject to the jurisdiction thereof’ — applies specifically to people who are in the country illegally,” Vice President Mike Pence told Politico in an interview on Tuesday, several hours after Mr. Trump’s comments were reported.It is likewise unknown how serious Mr. Trump is about taking the action.To accomplish the idea he floated on Tuesday, Mr. Trump would have to find a way around the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, which states, “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.”The amendment means that any child born in the United States is considered a citizen.Some conservatives have long made the argument that the 14th Amendment was meant to apply only to citizens and legal permanent residents, not immigrants who are present in the country without authorization.“The notion that simply being born within the geographical limits of the United States automatically confers U.S. citizenship is an absurdity — historically, constitutionally, philosophically and practically,” Mr. Anton wrote in July.Mr. Trump told Axios that while he initially believed he needed a constitutional amendment or action by Congress to make the change, the White House Counsel’s Office has advised him otherwise.“Now they’re saying I can do it just with an executive order,” Mr. Trump said.His discussion of the idea comes after the administration announced it was streaming more than 5,000 active-duty troops to the southern border, part of an election-season rash of executive action Mr. Trump has undertaken as he works to energize his anti-immigrant base.It also follows action by the Trump administration to try to discourage legal immigrants from using public benefits through a new federal rule that would deny green card status to people who use social safety net services, like food assistance and Medicaid.The proposal provoked outrage among civil rights groups, a response that Mr. Trump’s advisers have argued privately is a central objective of many of the president’s most aggressive proposals on immigration and other matters.Jess Morales Rocketto, the chairwoman of Families Belong Together, an immigrant advocacy group, called the idea “ethnic cleansing.”Kristen Clarke, the president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, called the idea illegal and offensive.“Aside from being unconstitutional, such an executive order would exacerbate racial tensions, exploit fears and drive further polarization across the country at a moment that calls for the promotion of unity and inclusion,” Ms. Clarke said in a statement.Some Republicans also rejected Mr. Trump’s suggestion, an indication of the political risks for the party that attend the president’s bid to stoke anti-immigrant sentiment in advance of next Tuesday’s voting.“The President is wrong to end #BirthrightCitizenship,” Bob Hugin, a Republican candidate for Senate in New Jersey, said in a Twitter post.A 1898 Supreme Court decision held that Wong Kim Ark, who was born in San Francisco to Chinese parents residing in the United States, was a citizen because of his birth on American soil.But immigration advocates argue that scrapping the concept of birthright citizenship would do away with a vital principle, and would be counterproductive to the stated goals of those who, like Mr. Trump, rail routinely against illegal immigration.Stephen Legomsky, a Washington University School of Law professor and former chief counsel for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, said the 14th Amendment’s application to the children of undocumented immigrants was a matter of pure common sense.“Like anyone else, native-born Americans, whoever their parents are, can be charged with crimes if they disobey U.S. law,” Mr. Legomsky said.",liberal
"FBI official Peter Strzok, who played a lead role in both the Russian meddling and Hillary Clinton email probes but became a political lightning rod after the revelation of anti-Trump text messages, has been fired.Strzok attorney Aitan Goelman said in a statement Monday that his client, a 21-year FBI veteran, was fired Friday afternoon, claiming this was a departure from standard practice and politically motivated. “This decision should be deeply troubling to all Americans,” the attorney said. The FBI responded: “Mr. Strzok was subject to the standard FBI review and disciplinary process after conduct highlighted in the IG report was referred to the FBI’s Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR). Strzok appeared to launch a new Twitter account to fire back, saying he's ""deeply saddened"" by the decision and linking to a GoFundMe page. President Trump and his allies for months, though, have hammered the former FBI agent and cast him as the poster child for anti-Trump bias within the bureau and Justice Department. Reacting to the firing, the president tweeted, ""finally,"" while asking whether the Russia case will now be dropped:""Agent Peter Strzok was just fired from the FBI - finally. The president over the weekend had tweeted that Strzok and others have “badly damaged” the FBI’s reputation, referring to them as “clowns and losers!” Strzok was removed from the special counsel probe last year after the discovery that he exchanged anti-Trump and other politically charged messages with colleague and lover Lisa Page. Judicial Watch Director of Investigations Chris Farrell on how FBI official Peter Strzok requested that he retain his security clearance after being added to special counsel Robert Mueller's team. The IG ultimately found no evidence that the bias among the several FBI agents impacted prosecutorial decisions in the Clinton email probe. One Strzok text in particular vowed to ""stop"" Trump from becoming president. In an explosive congressional hearing last month, Strzok sought to clear his name and address the many controversial messages. Trump's allies cheered the former agent's termination on Monday. ""Peter Strzok was fired from the FBI because of what his own written words plainly showed: Strzok’s attorney, meanwhile, blasted the bureau on Monday, saying the deputy director “reversed the decision of the career FBI official responsible for employee discipline who concluded, through an independent review process, that a 60-day suspension and demotion from supervisory duties was the appropriate punishment.”He added, “A lengthy investigation and multiple rounds of Congressional testimony failed to produce a shred of evidence that Special Agent Strzok’s personal views ever affected his work.” The Justice Department declined to comment for this report. Text messages first emerged last year, showing Strzok and Page discussing 2016 campaign politics and repeatedly blasting Trump. Messages continued to trickle out, including some reflecting apparent concern about being too tough on Clinton during the investigation into her private email system use. The inspector general report, meanwhile, referred a total of five FBI employees for investigation in connection with politically charged texts, suggesting more disciplinary action could be considered for additional employees.

"WASHINGTON — Representative Duncan Hunter was indicted by a federal grand jury in San Diego on Tuesday after a monthslong criminal investigation into allegations that he spent tens of thousands of dollars in campaign funds on family trips to Hawaii and Italy, private school tuition for his children and even a $600 airline ticket for a pet rabbit.In a 48-page indictment released by the Justice Department, Mr. Hunter, Republican of California, and his wife, Margaret, are charged with converting more than $250,000 in campaign funds to pay for personal expenses and filing false campaign finance records with the Federal Election Commission.Mr. Hunter, 41, becomes the second Republican congressman to be indicted this month.Mr. Collins, who is accused of passing insider information to his son about a drug company on whose board he served, has said he expects to be “fully vindicated and exonerated.”A spokesman for Mr. Hunter, Michael Harrison, said Tuesday that the congressman “believes this action is purely politically motivated,” and referred a reporter to a letter that Mr. Hunter’s lawyer, Gregory A. Vega, sent this month to Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general.The back-to-back indictments are all but certain to give ammunition to Democrats, who have been promising to clean up corruption in Washington if voters give them control of the House.And for California Republicans, it has immediate implications, expanding from seven to eight the field of Republican-held seats being seriously targeted by Democrats.Mr. Hunter easily won California’s nonpartisan primary with 48 percent of the vote; the next highest vote-getter, Ammar Campa-Najjar, a Democrat, took only 17 percent.“The division, chaos and corruption in Washington has gone too far,” Mr. Campa-Najjar said in a statement.The indictment details scores of instances, beginning in 2009 and continuing through 2016, in which the Justice Department said the Hunters spent campaign money on themselves.“The indictment alleges that Congressman Hunter and his wife repeatedly dipped into campaign coffers as if they were personal bank accounts, and falsified F.E.C. campaign finance reports to cover their tracks,” Adam L. Braverman, the United States attorney for the Southern District of California, said in a statement, referring to the Federal Election Commission.“Elected representatives should jealously guard the public’s trust, not abuse their positions for personal gain,” Mr. Braverman added.Beyond the family vacations and private school tuition, the indictment said expenses included dental work, theater tickets, and domestic and international travel for almost a dozen relatives, as well as “tens of thousands of dollars on smaller purchases, including fast food, movie tickets, golf outings, video games, coffee, groceries, home utilities and expensive meals,” according to a statement released by the Justice Department.The “cabin rabbit transport fees” were first reported in January 2017 by a California newspaper, The Press-Enterprise.To conceal their personal spending, the Hunters mischaracterized the purchases as “campaign travel,” “dinner with volunteers/contributors,” “toy drives,” “teacher/parent and supporter events,” “gift cards” for charitable donations and “gift basket items,” the statement said.Family dental bills paid with campaign funds were characterized as a charitable contribution to “Smiles for Life.”The Hunters are scheduled to be arraigned Thursday morning in San Diego.A former Marine in Iraq and Afghanistan, Mr. Hunter was first elected in 2008 to a seat held by his father, and now serves on the House Armed Services Committee.By March 2017, when the Justice Department opened its criminal investigation, Mr. Hunter was already being investigated by the House Ethics Committee.",center
"Democrats urge Trump to cancel Putin summit, after indictment of Russian intel officersTop Democrats on Friday swiftly pressured President Trump to consider cancelling his upcoming summit with Vladimir Putin, after a dozen Russian intelligence officers were indicted for allegedly hacking party emails in 2016.Sen. Mark Warner, top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, offered Trump an ultimatum for the highly anticipated summit: make Russian interference a priority, or cancel the meeting.Other Democrats said Trump should nix the summit regardless -- though they were raising concerns about the meeting even before the indictment.Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein announced the charges during a Friday press conference.“I want to make sure that other Americans hear ... the president make this issue of Russian interference a priority in the meeting,” Warner, D-Va., told reporters on Capitol Hill Friday.Warner, whose committee has been investigating Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates in the 2016 election for more than a year, also stressed that there “needs to be other Americans in the room” in Helsinki, Finland Monday to ensure that Trump makes the issue of interference in the 2016 election a “priority.”“There should be no one-on-one meeting between this president and Putin,” Warner said.He warned, “I’m afraid the president could be taken advantage of.”But as Trump continues to describe the Russia probe as a ""witch hunt,"" the White House downplayed the latest allegations.“Today’s charges include no allegations of knowing involvement by anyone on the campaign and no allegations that the alleged hacking affected the election result,” said Lindsay Walters, the deputy White House press secretary.Within minutes of the indictment, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., urged Trump to call off the Putin meeting.“Cancel the Putin meeting. Now,” Schumer tweeted Friday.Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said a handshake with Putin would be ""a moment of historic cowardice.""""In light of what's been revealed about Russia’s attack on our democracy, the president shaking Putin's hand would be a moment of historic cowardice.Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., said Trump should “immediately cancel his meeting.”House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said “the stakes” for the summit “could not be higher.”“President Trump must demand and secure a real, concrete and comprehensive agreement that the Russians will cease their ongoing attacks on our democracy,” Pelosi said in a statement Friday.Presuming the meeting takes place as scheduled, Helsinki will be the final stop on Trump’s four-nation European tour.Trump spent the past week meeting with NATO allies in Brussels; meeting with British Prime Minister Theresa May and Queen Elizabeth II in England; and visiting Scotland.",liberal
"Liberals Fume At 'Worst Negotiator' Chuck Schumer After Deal To End ShutdownWASHINGTON ― Democrats provided votes to fund the government on Monday in exchange for an assurance from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) that he would put an immigration bill on the floor in the coming weeks.Liberal groups, which are deeply skeptical whether Republicans will keep their word after years of inaction on codifying protections for the undocumented young people often called Dreamers, angrily slammed Democrats ― and in particular Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) ― for giving away leverage with no firm promise that an immigration bill would reach President Donald Trump’s desk.“It’s official: Chuck Schumer is the worst negotiator in Washington ― even worse than Trump.CREDO Action, the activist arm of the wireless phone company, advocates for progressive causes, including immigrants rights and the passage of legislation that would give Dreamers a pathway to citizenship.MoveOn.org, one of the most influential progressive organizations in Washington, similarly panned the agreement that 33 Senate Democrats voted to advance to a final vote on Monday.“This is a bad, outrageous deal.McConnell said over the weekend that he intends to move to vote on an immigration bill if both parties can’t agree to one by Feb. 8, as long as the government is still fully open.“I believe Sen. McConnell will follow through,” independent Sen. Angus King of Maine, who caucuses with the Democrats, told reporters on Monday.Other Democrats, such as Sen. Kamala Harris (Calif.), remained unconvinced that McConnell and the House Republicans would follow through on immigration.“I don’t believe he made any commitment whatsoever and I think it would be foolhardy to believe that he made a commitment,” Harris said.While Senate Democrats did not receive everything they asked for in exchange for voting to reopen the government, they did manage to get the Children’s Health Insurance Program funded for six years.For now, though, Democrats who voted to reopen the government said that simply pushing the conversation in the right direction was a victory on its own.“I don’t think I can guarantee a House outcome but I think the stronger the bill, in terms of the strength of the bipartisanship in the bill ― the odds go up in the House,” Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) told HuffPost on Monday.",center
"President Trump vowed Wednesday that birthright citizenship will end “one way or the other,” a day after it emerged he was considering killing the policy by executive order -- a development that sparked disagreement among Republicans and condemnation from Democrats.“So-called Birthright Citizenship, which costs our Country billions of dollars and is very unfair to our citizens, will be ended one way or the other,” he tweeted. He also took aim at former Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, who he said “was right in 1993, before he and the Democrats went insane and started with the Open Borders (which brings massive crime) ‘stuff.’”He was referring to comments unearthed from 1993 in which Reid said that ""no sane country"" would award citizenship to children of illegal immigrants born on its soil and promoted legislation to end the practice.""If making it easy to be an illegal alien isn't enough, how about offering a reward for being an illegal immigrant? Reid later apologized for his stance and reversed it in 1999.But the comments helped Trump make his controversial case, after his push first emerged in an interview with “Axios on HBO”. “How ridiculous, we’re the only country in the world where a person comes in, has a baby, and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United States for 85 years with all of those benefits,” Trump said.The U.S. is not the only country to grant birthright citizenship, with Canada and a number of Latin American countries also doing so, but the issue has long been a contentious one in the U.S. -- particularly for those seeking to restrict illegal immigration into the U.S.The 14th Amendment states that “all persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.” Critics say the policy encourages illegal immigrants to come to the country, give birth and then try to claim residency themselves as a result.But many scholars counter that it would take a constitutional amendment to change the policy. Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said in an interview with WVLK that the 14th Amendment is “pretty clear” and said that “you cannot end birthright citizenship with an executive order.” Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., announced he will be introducing legislation “to deal with the issue of birthright citizenship for children of illegal immigrants” and said it was a “magnet for illegal immigration in modern times.”On Wednesday, Trump appeared to shift stance somewhat by avoiding saying it would be ended by executive order, while acknowledging the matter “will be settled by the United States Supreme Court.”Democrats appeared united in condemnation against Trump’s move this week. ""This is just more of the same of what he's been saying,"" she said, referring to Trump's remarks on immigration. ",liberal
"WASHINGTON — Peter Strzok, the F.B.I. senior counterintelligence agent who disparaged President Trump in inflammatory text messages and helped oversee the Hillary Clinton email and Russia investigations, has been fired for violating bureau policies, Mr. Strzok’s lawyer said Monday.Mr. Trump and his allies seized on the texts — exchanged during the 2016 campaign with a former F.B.I. lawyer, Lisa Page — in assailing the Russia investigation as an illegitimate “witch hunt.” Along with writing the texts, Mr. Strzok was accused of sending a highly sensitive search warrant to his personal email account.The F.B.I. had been under immense political pressure by Mr. Trump to dismiss Mr. Strzok, who was removed last summer from the staff of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. Mr. Trump’s victory traces back to June, when Mr. Strzok’s conduct was laid out in a wide-ranging inspector general’s report on how the F.B.I. handled the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s emails in the run-up to the 2016 election. But Mr. Strzok’s lawyer said the deputy director of the F.B.I., David Bowdich, had overruled the Office of Professional Responsibility and fired Mr. Strzok.A spokeswoman for the F.B.I. did not respond to a message seeking comment about why Mr. Strzok was dismissed rather than demoted. Aitan Goelman, Mr. Strzok’s lawyer, denounced his client’s dismissal. “This decision should be deeply troubling to all Americans,” Mr. Goelman added. Mr. Strzok’s text exchanges with Ms. Page demonstrated animosity toward Mr. Trump. The report by the inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, that preceded Mr. Strzok’s firing not only criticized his conduct in sending the texts but also his use of personal email accounts to handle sensitive information. Mr. Horowitz said in his report that he was “deeply troubled” by the text messages. On Twitter, Mr. Strzok said he was “deeply saddened by this decision,” adding, “It has been an honor to serve my country and work with the fine men and women of the FBI.”Mr. Strzok became emblematic of Mr. Trump’s unfounded assertions that a so-called deep state of bureaucrats opposed to him was undermining his presidency. After Mr. Horowitz uncovered the texts, Mr. Mueller, who had by then taken over the investigation, removed Mr. Strzok from his team. The inspector general’s report also took issue with the reaction by Mr. Strzok and other F.B.I. officials to the discovery of possible new evidence in the Clinton investigation, known internally as Midyear Exam, in late September 2016 on a laptop that belonged to the disgraced politician Anthony D. Weiner, the husband of a top Clinton aide.At the time, Mr. Strzok was in the early stages of investigating whether any Trump associates had conspired with Russia’s interference in the presidential election, and nearly a month passed before agents and analysts began to act on the emails found on Mr. Weiner’s laptop. “Under these circumstances, we did not have confidence that Strzok’s decision to prioritize the Russia investigation over following up on the Midyear-related investigative lead discovered on the Weiner laptop was free from bias,” he wrote.The delays were merely the “result of bureaucratic snafus,” Mr. Strzok’s lawyer wrote last month in USA Today.But the justifications for the delay were “unpersuasive” and had “far-reaching consequences,” the inspector general said. In addition, the inspector general said that Mr. Strzok had forwarded a proposed search warrant to his personal email account. In a heated congressional hearing last month, Mr. Strzok expressed “significant regret” for the texts and rebutted the president’s attacks on the Russia inquiry. Mr. Strzok’s dismissal was not unexpected. The firing was politically motivated, Mr. McCabe has said, as an effort to discredit him as a witness in the special counsel investigation.Both men were fired before they were eligible for their pension and health benefits.Mr. Strzok, 48, a graduate of Georgetown University, served as an officer in the Army before he joined the F.B.I. He handled many important espionage cases including one involving a former C.I.A. officer suspected of working for China and a group of Russian spies who had been working undercover in the United States.",conservative
"Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., and his wife, Margaret, were indicted on charges of illegally converting $250,000 in campaign funds for personal expenses and filing false records, prosecutors announced Tuesday.In response, House Speaker Paul Ryan said Tuesday evening that he would remove the congressman from all committee assignments for the time being, calling the charges against Hunter “deeply serious.”Among the allegations named in the 48-page indictment included instances between 2009 and 2016 when Hunter and his wife used campaign funds to pay for family vacations to Italy and Hawaii, school tuition, dental work, and even domestic and international travel for almost a dozen relatives, according to a press release from the Southern District of California’s U.S. Attorney’s Office.The indictment also alleged that the pair spent “tens of thousands of dollars” on items ranging from movie tickets, fast food, golf outings, groceries and home utilities.Fox News obtained a letter sent from Hunter's attorney, Gregory A. Vega, to U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein on Aug. 6 asking him to postpone the indictment.Vega contended that there was a ""rush to indict"" after a two-year grand jury investigation.Vega asserted the prosecution was ""politically motivated"" because of Hunter's early support of Donald Trump for president.The congressman's lawyers said in 2017 that Hunter and his wife repaid the campaign about $60,000.Prosecutors said Hunter and his wife “mischaracterized” the purchases in Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings to hide the illicit spending.“Family dental bills paid with campaign funds were characterized as a charitable contribution to ‘Smiles for Life,’” the press release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office said as an example.Charges included conspiracy to commit offenses against the United States, wire fraud and falsifying records.Hunter, one of Trump’s earliest supporters in the presidential race, allegedly was aware of what he and his wife were doing and continued to spend campaign funds on personal expenses despite multiple warnings from his campaign treasurer about “questionable purchases.”“According to the indictment, the Hunters knew that many of their desired purchases could be made only by using campaign funds, since they did not otherwise have sufficient personal funds to pay for their purchases,” according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office.U.S. Attorney Adam Braverman said Tuesday’s indictment proved that “no one is above the law.”The pair is due to be arraigned in court on Thursday morning.",liberal
"Democrats Say Trump Should Cancel Putin Meeting After IndictmentsWASHINGTON — Leading Democrats called Friday for President Trump to cancel his upcoming meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia after the Justice Department indicted 12 Russian intelligence officers accused of hacking Democrats’ emails and computer networks during the 2016 presidential race.Top Republicans were mostly mute, though a handful — including Representative Ed Royce of California, the retiring chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee; Senator John McCain of Arizona, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, who has brain cancer; and Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, a frequent critic of Mr. Trump — urged the president to use the indictments to get tough with Mr. Putin when they meet on Monday in Helsinki, Finland.“President Trump must be willing to confront Putin from a position of strength and demonstrate that there will be a serious price to pay for his ongoing aggression towards the United States and democracies around the world,” Mr. McCain said in a statement.A grand jury indicted the officers on Friday, accusing them of conspiring to interfere with the outcome of the 2016 presidential election by hacking the Democratic National Committee, Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.“These indictments are further proof of what everyone but the president seems to understand: President Putin is an adversary who interfered in our elections to help President Trump win,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said, adding that Mr. Trump should cancel the meeting “until Russia takes demonstrable and transparent steps to prove that they won’t interfere in future elections.”A number of Democrats lined up behind Mr. Schumer.Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, stopped short of calling on Mr. Trump to cancel, but he said the president should insist that other Americans be present and should demand that Mr. Putin extradite those indicted.“I would not trust the president alone with Putin without some other Americans in the administration in there,” he said.The charges were announced here on Friday by Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, who made clear during a news conference that the Justice Department views the hacking not as an attack on one party, but as an attack against the United States.“It’s important for us to avoid thinking politically, as Republicans or Democrats, and instead to think patriotically as Americans,” Mr. Rosenstein said.Mr. Sasse echoed that sentiment.“The U.S. intelligence community knows that the Russian government attacked the U.S.,” Mr. Sasse said.But with the exception of Mr. McCain, Republicans steered clear of discussing whether Mr. Trump should cancel Monday’s meeting in Helsinki.Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, a founder of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, asked if Mr. Trump should demand extradition of the hackers, said, “I’ll leave that to the president.”The chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina, said he intends to hold a hearing on election security at the end of July.But Mr. Royce, of California, called Friday for Mr. Trump to “use today’s indictments to challenge”",conservative

"Texas Congressman Who Settled Harassment Case With Taxpayer Funds ResignsRepresentative Blake Farenthold, Republican of Texas, in December at the Capitol.CreditJoshua Roberts/ReutersWASHINGTON — Representative Blake Farenthold, the Texas Republican who used $84,000 in taxpayer funds to settle a sexual harassment case with his former communications director, abruptly resigned from Congress on Friday afternoon.In December, Mr. Farenthold, who represented the 27th District of Texas, said that he would not run for re-election amid scrutiny over the payment and accusations from other aides that he set the tone for a hostile work environment in his office.“While I planned on serving out the remainder of my term in Congress, I know in my heart it’s time for me to move along and look for new ways to serve,” Mr. Farenthold said in a statement on Friday, thanking his staff, his family and the voters who elected him.It was known for several years that Mr. Farenthold, already notorious for a heavily circulated photograph of him in duck pajamas, had been accused of sexual harassment by Lauren Greene, his former communications director.But in December, the extent of Mr. Farenthold’s settlement was revealed when Congress’s Office of Compliance released details of six settlements that it had paid out since 2013 as part of a review of discrimination and sexual harassment in congressional offices.“While I 100 percent support more transparency with respect to claims against members of Congress, I can neither confirm nor deny that settlement involved my office,” Mr. Farenthold said at the time.A decision in 2015 by the Office of Congressional Ethics, an independent, nonpartisan board, cleared him of wrongdoing, and he promised to repay the settlement.A spokeswoman for Mr. Farenthold did not respond to questions about whether he had fulfilled that promise or whether he would do so after resigning.“Mr. Farenthold made a commitment that he would reimburse taxpayers for the settlement,” said AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Speaker Paul Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin.Representative Steve Stivers, Republican of Ohio and the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, also said in a statement that he hoped Mr. Farenthold would be “true to his word” and pay back the taxpayer money.After the disclosure, more of his aides came forward to accuse Mr. Farenthold of fostering a hostile environment, describing a congressman with a harsh temper who made sexually explicit jokes and engaged in casual sexual banter.The House Ethics Committee also opened a subcommittee investigation into Ms. Greene’s allegations.In a video in December announcing his resignation, Mr. Farenthold continued to deny the allegations, but he acknowledged running an “unprofessional” workplace and said he was “profoundly sorry” for his actions.After his resignation on Friday, Mr. Farenthold deleted his Twitter account and the Facebook campaign page where he first announced his decision to not seek re-election.“Leaving my service in the House,” he said in his statement, “I’m able to look back at the entirety of my career in public office and say that it was well worthwhile.”",conservative

"WASHINGTON ― FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok, who was taken off special counsel Robert Mueller’s team after Justice Department investigators discovered his texts disparaging President Donald Trump, has been fired from the bureau despite the recommendations of a career FBI official.Aitan Goelman, Strzok’s attorney, said in a statement that Strzok was fired late Friday afternoon on the orders of FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich, despite an FBI career official’s recommendation that Strzok face a 60-day suspension and a demotion.Goelman called the decision “a departure from typical Bureau practice” and said it contradicted FBI Director Chris Wray’s earlier guarantee that the bureau would follow its regular process, despite Trump’s disdain for the now-former FBI official.“This decision should be deeply troubling to all Americans.Strzok exchanged texts with former FBI official Lisa Page that disparaged Trump as well as other politicians, including various Democrats.Strzok, a 21-year veteran of the FBI, played a prominent role in both of the investigations surrounding the Clinton and Trump campaigns during the 2016 election.The precise justification for Bowdich’s decision to fire Strzok despite the recommendation of the FBI’s Office of Professional Responsibility is unclear.It’s possible that the former FBI counterintelligence official’s extramarital relationship with Page also played a role in the FBI’s decision.Trump celebrated Strzok’s firing on Twitter, writing Monday that the investigation into his campaign “should be dropped” and that the investigation into Clinton “should be properly redone.”",conservative
"Senate Democrats’ Vote to End Shutdown Infuriates Some on the LeftWASHINGTON — The decision by Senate Democrats to end the government shutdown on Monday in exchange for a promised immigration vote enraged liberals, who accused the lawmakers of betrayal and threatened to mount primaries against some of the Democrats who voted yes.Regardless of what happens in the Senate, progressive and immigrant advocacy groups said House Republican leaders will never take up a bill that would offer legal status to young undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children without excruciating concessions on other immigration issues.“They blinked because they’ll always put the party and the success of the party first,” said Representative Luis V. Gutiérrez of Illinois, one of the leading Democratic advocates for immigrants, complaining that Hispanics got short shrift.The hasty retreat by 33 Senate Democrats was particularly humiliating in the immediate aftermath of the anniversary of the Women’s March, which saw thousands of activists reconvene in cities across the country to protest against President Trump and congressional Republicans.By noon, their own ostensible allies in Congress had buckled.“The grass-roots are rightly furious with a slew of elected Democrats,” said Ben Wikler, the Washington director of MoveOn.org.The anger on the left was reminiscent of conservative unrest that fueled primary race challenges against sitting Republican senators accused of appeasing an opposition president, Barack Obama, and his congressional allies.Mr. Schumer, determined to keep the fissures in his party coalition muted, used a meeting of Senate Democrats before the vote to urge the liberals in his caucus not to criticize those voting to reopen the government, according to one senator who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private meeting.And for the most part, the liberal senators who opposed the agreement held their fire.And Senate Democrats have crushed most primary election challenges easily.Former Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, said Democrats from the more rural states that make up much of the 2018 map would prefer to battle over issues other than immigration.“Our major issues are jobs, Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, Social Security, infrastructure, supporting domestic programs, clean air, safe drinking water,” Mr. Dorgan said, adding of his conservative-state brethren, “While those Democrats do strongly support DACA, I’m sure they would prefer to be discussing different issues.”But the patience of the left may be running thin.Faiz Shakir, the political director of the American Civil Liberties Union and an adviser to former Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, said the group and its allies were actively exploring places to intervene in primary elections.Mr. Shakir said of some Democrats that it is an “open question, still, whether they’re going to fight for Dreamers.”Right now, only one Democratic senator faces a serious primary challenge: Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, who voted against the government-funding deal and complained privately that she and most of her colleagues had been asked to vote on Friday against a nearly identical measure to keep the government open.Ms. Feinstein has tacked to the left since Kevin de Léon, the president of the California State Senate, announced his challenge to her in October.Mr. de Léon said Monday that Democrats had made a grave mistake striking “another fingers-crossed bargain with Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell.”Mr. de Léon said he had called and left a voice mail message with Thomas E. Perez, the Democratic National Committee chairman, and planned to convey that Democrats had sent a terrible message to “voters of color and millennial voters who feel like they’ve been abandoned.”“Once again, the party’s leaders in Washington have capitulated, compromised and redrawn a line in the sand even further away from justice,” he said.One House Democrat is already under fire for not taking a stronger stance on behalf of immigrants: Representative Daniel Lipinski of Illinois, a moderate Democrat from Chicago who is facing a primary race challenger, Marie Newman, in March.“I asked him to sign on to Dream bill.The chances of a successful primary election challenge in the Senate are far more remote.Of the 10 Democrats who gathered outside the Senate chamber after the vote to crow about their bipartisan agreement, six are on the ballot this year.“If you want results, you have to compromise, and if you’re unwilling to compromise, you won’t get results,” said Senator Heidi Heitkamp, Democrat of North Dakota.Progressives, however, are already eyeing one of the Democrats who pushed for a compromise: Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.Ms. Klobuchar, however, illustrates why the Democratic base may find it difficult to inflict payback: She is broadly popular with liberals in Minnesota, and the shutdown fight has come late enough in the congressional calendar to leave any would-be challenger with little time to prepare.“I have been working hard for the people of Minnesota, and I think the people of Minnesota understand that, including in my party,” Ms. Klobuchar said.",liberal
"A male suspect was arrested in Florida on Friday morning in connection with the rash of suspicious packages sent to prominent Democrats nationwide, law enforcement sources confirmed to Fox News.Multiple sources identified the suspect to Fox News as Cesar Sayoc of Aventura, Florida.A separate law enforcement source told Fox News that the suspect is a white male in his 50s, who used to live in New York and had prior arrests for terroristic threats. The Department of Justice will hold a press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET.Federal authorities had been focusing on Florida as the location where the majority of packages originated.“Some of the packages went through the mail,” Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen earlier told Fox News. The Miami-Dade County Police Department confirmed Thursday it was helping federal agents who were at the facility in Opa-locka as part of the ongoing investigation.The USPS operates an innovative imaging system that photographs each piece of mail processed throughout the country. The FBI said the packages each consisted of a manila envelope with a bubble-wrap interior containing potentially destructive devices. A government source told Fox News the FBI was analyzing the stamps in Quantico. The envelopes and packaging materials likely contained a treasure trove of DNA information. The Washington, D.C., field office and the FBI headquarters had 24 teams in place and on the hunt for the culprit.Forensic investigators in Quantico, Va., have been sifting through the packages addressed to former President Barack Obama, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, liberal billionaire George Soros, former Attorney General Eric Holder, former CIA Director John Brennan and California Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters.The devices are thought to have been fashioned from crude, bomb-making designs widely available on the Internet. Ryan Morris, founder of Tripwire Operation Group, a company that provides explosives training to law enforcement and military officials, called the devices “Mickey Mouse” bombs that were meant to be found. Regardless, investigators were treating the devices as “live” explosives New York City Police Commissioner James O’Neill said.Larry Johnson, a former head of criminal investigations for the U.S. Secret Service who also served as a special agent in charge of the presidential protective detail, agreed that bomb makers usually leave evidence – and their signature- behind.“If there is a human involved, there is a high probability you’re going to get somewhere investigatively,” he told The Associated Press. Johnson believes it’s “highly likely” the person who built the bombs will have been previously flagged by law enforcement. James Fitzgerald, a retired FBI profiler and forensic linguist who, in 1996, helped catch ""Unabomber"" Ted Kaczynski -- who killed 3 people and injured 23 in bombings between 1978 and 1995 -- told Fox News on Wednesday that the letter sent to John Brennan, the former director of the CIA and a staunch Trump critic, reminded him of something the Unabomber would send because of the number of stamps used on the package.“The linguist in me noticed that Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the last name is spelled missing a ‘c’ and John Brennan’s name is spelled missing an ‘n’ and that kind of surprised me and I have a feeling that was done on purpose to make this look like somebody who doesn’t really know who these people are and that it wasn’t an honest mistake.

"President Trump on Saturday took aim at social media tech giants for “discriminating” against Republicans and conservatives -- saying that “too many voices are being destroyed” and promising that his administration would not allow it to happen.“Who is making the choices, because I can already tell you that too many mistakes are being made. Both Facebook and Twitter have been under fire for allegedly censoring accounts, while ignoring rules violations by liberal and left-wing users. Trump uses Twitter on a daily basis, and his campaign was credited for its use of Facebook as one of the ways it secured its victory in November 2016.While conservatives have complained for years about what they say is discrimination by the tech giants, the controversy escalated last month when Vice News reported the issue, saying that accounts from top Republicans including GOP Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel were being given limited visibility on Twitter. ""We do not shadow ban. ""We do rank tweets and search results. A Facebook executive apologized last month for mistreating Diamond and Silk -- two pro-Trump personalities who have long claimed they are being censored by the platform, but the company has also denied being biased against conservatives.“We badly mishandled our communications with them,” Monika Bickert, head of Global Policy Management at Facebook, said at a House Judiciary Committee hearing.But that has done little to calm the controversy, and Trump on Saturday accused social media sites of “closing down the opinions of many people on the right, while at the same time doing nothing to others.”""Too many voices are being destroyed, some good & some bad, and that cannot be allowed to happen,"" he tweeted.He went on to call censorship “a dangerous thing” and then took a swipe at CNN and MSNBC, saying that while they are “fake,” he does not demand that offending content be taken off air.“If you are weeding out Fake News, there is nothing so Fake as CNN & MSNBC, & yet I do not ask that their sick behavior be removed,” he tweeted.

"President Trump announced Sunday that Defense Secretary James Mattis will be leaving the administration on January 1, weeks earlier than planned and just days after Mattis' bombshell resignation letter made clear his policy disagreements with the White House.""I am pleased to announce that our very talented Deputy Secretary of Defense, Patrick Shanahan, will assume the title of Acting Secretary of Defense starting January 1, 2019,"" Trump wrote on Twitter Sunday morning. ""Patrick has a long list of accomplishments while serving as Deputy, & previously Boeing. He will be great!""Shanahan is a former Boeing executive who joined the Pentagon in July 2017.In his resignation letter Thursday, Mattis, 68, had said he would remain in his role for more than three months. Also on Thursday, Trump had said Mattis -- the first Cabinet official in 40 years to resign over a stated policy difference with the president -- was leaving in February.""The end date for my tenure is February 28, 2019, a date that should allow sufficient time for a successor to be nominated and confirmed as well as to make sure the Department's interests are properly articulated and protected at upcoming events to include Congressional posture hearings and the NATO Defense Ministerial meeting in February,"" Mattis wrote Thursday.It was not immediately clear why Mattis' departure date was apparently moved up, but tension in the Defense Department and Washington generally has skyrocketed in the days since he suddenly announced his resignation.Sources told Fox News this week that Mattis had quit ""in protest"" over the president's national security policies and that more resignations could be coming. (In 2013, then-President Obama removed Mattis from his post running U.S. military's Central Command, reportedly without calling to notify him of the decision.)U.S. officials said this week that the Trump administration is making plans to pull all 2,000 troops out of Syria, and Trump later tweeted that “we have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency.”Trump has stood by his Syria decision despite fierce blowback, telling detractors that the pullout should come as “no surprise” given his 2016 campaign promises and arguing that America’s role as “Policeman of the Middle East” is not worth the sacrifice.Ground troops moved into Syria in 2015 to combat ISIS in the region, amid an escalating Syrian civil war. Trump had talked about pulling out of Syria before, but military leaders had warned about ISIS re-emerging should the U.S. do so. There is also concern about abandoning the U.S.' Kurdish allies.The news that Mattis will be leaving sooner than expected comes just days after Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy for the global coalition to defeat Islamic State (ISIS), on Saturday accelerated his planned departure and announced his resignation.The Associated Press reported that McGurk said in a resignation letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that ISIS was on the run, but wasn’t yet defeated and that U.S. work in Syria wasn’t yet done. Fox News has confirmed that McGurk submitted his resignation letter on Friday, a day after Mattis resigned. His resignation is effective December 31.The president downplayed the news via Twitter Saturday evening, saying he had neither met McGurk nor appointed him.""Brett McGurk, who I do not know, was appointed by President Obama in 2015. Was supposed to leave in February but he just resigned prior to leaving,"" Trump tweeted. ""Grandstander? The Fake News is making such a big deal about this nothing event!""""If anybody but your favorite President, Donald J. Trump, announced that, after decimating ISIS in Syria, we were going to bring our troops back home (happy & healthy), that person would be the most popular hero in America,"" he continued in a follow-up tweet. ""With me, hit hard instead by the Fake News Media. Crazy!""Meanwhile, the White House's plan to withdraw half its troops in Afghanistan by the summer -- some 7,000 soldiers -- has drawn similar criticism. While President Obama repeatedly promised to pull all troops out of Afghanistan by 2014, U.S. and NATO forces remain there in a predominately training and advising role.Afghanistan's security forces rely heavily on U.S. airpower against both Taliban and an upstart Islamic State affiliate. More than 2,400 American soldiers have died in Afghanistan since the 2001 U.S.-led invasion, and Trump announced in a video last week that troop deaths were on his mind in announcing the pullouts.",conservative
"Splashed across the cover of this week’s Newsweek magazine is a picture of the Republican presidential candidate and Tea Party favorite Representative Michele Bachmann.Many in the conservative blogosphere are not pleased.“Exactly what were the editors thinking putting this kind of a picture of a sitting congresswoman and presidential candidate on their cover?” wrote Noel Sheppard on the conservative Web site News Busters, under the headline “Newsweek Puts Picture of Michele Bachmann on Cover That Makes Her Look Crazy.”A blogger on the Web site Freedom’s Lighthouse said, “Can anyone really say with a straight face that the Mainstream Media is not totally biased against conservatives?”But even some unlikely allies have emerged to decry the cover as disrespectful.“It’s sexist,” said Terry O’Neill, the president of the National Organization for Women, to the news Web site the Daily Caller, which is run by the conservative commentator Tucker Carlson.“Gloria Steinem has a very simple test,” Ms. O’Neill continued.Monday night, Newsweek responded to the controversy by posting an “outtakes” gallery on its Daily Beast Web site, showcasing other photos taken for the article.The cover goes with an article by Lois Romano about Ms. Bachmann’s place in the Tea Party movement and on the national stage.This is not the first time Newsweek has caused a stir with its cover choices.Just this past June, the news magazine ran a computer generated image of Catherine, the new Duchess of Cambridge, walking alongside Princess Diana, who has been dead for nearly 14 years.The Atlantic Wire ran a story about that cover called, simply, “How Creepy Is Princess Diana’s Ghost on the Cover of Newsweek?”",center

"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court appeared closely divided on Tuesday during arguments over the theory put forth by the plaintiffs in an enormous sex discrimination class-action case against Wal-Mart.Even some justices who seemed sympathetic to the plaintiffs expressed qualms about how to administer a lawsuit involving as many as 1.5 million women seeking back pay that could amount to billions of dollars.The mere certification of a class-action suit can prompt defendants to settle in light of the sums at stake, and the justices struggled to find a way to distinguish between gaps in pay that might have benign explanations and those caused by unlawful discrimination.The court of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. has recently issued a series of rulings in favor of plaintiffs suing for employment discrimination that cut against the court’s pro-business reputation.The issue before the justices at Tuesday’s arguments was not whether Wal-Mart, the country’s largest retailer and biggest private employer, discriminated against women who worked there.The plaintiffs’ theory is that a centralized companywide policy gave local managers too much discretion in pay and promotion decisions, leaving Wal-Mart vulnerable to gender stereotypes.Wal-Mart calls that evidence unrepresentative and unreliable.Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said the theory about how the company discriminated — through a central policy conferring local discretion — was internally inconsistent.But Justice Stephen G. Breyer said Wal-Mart could be held accountable if it failed to take action in the face of reports of discrimination from its stores.Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg agreed, saying that companies had a responsibility to make sure that women were treated fairly in local workplaces.But Justice Antonin Scalia was unconvinced.“I’m getting whipsawed here,” he told the plaintiffs’ lawyer, Joseph M. Sellers.Mr. Sellers responded that “there is this broad discretion given the managers” but that “they do not make their decisions in a vacuum.” Managers, he went on, “are informed by the company about how to exercise that discretion.”That did not satisfy Justice Scalia.Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., a lawyer for Wal-Mart, said the handful of women named as plaintiffs who seek to represent the entire class did not have typical experiences at the company.“Each of the plaintiffs have very different stories,” he said.He added that “this class includes at least 544 store managers who are alleged to be discriminators and victims.”Several justices had practical concerns.“What seems to me a very serious problem in this case is, how do you work out the back pay?” Justice Ginsburg asked.Mr. Sellers said the trial court could rely on statistics culled from company databases, which he said were more reliable than the evidence that might be presented in individualized hearings given the available information about particular pay and promotion decisions.Given that, Mr. Sellers said, Wal-Mart’s personnel decisions were “standardless” and “recordless.”Justice Kennedy responded with a point about the suitability of the case for class-action treatment.Mr. Boutrous said Mr. Sellers was trying to have it both ways.“The problem here, Mr. Sellers says, is that the records are not available,” Mr. Boutrous said.Several justices voiced concerns about how many companies could be subject to class-action suits if they allowed the case against Wal-Mart to go forward.“Is it true,” Chief Justice Roberts asked Mr. Sellers, “that Wal-Mart’s pay disparity across the company was less than the national average?”Mr. Sellers said that was not the appropriate comparison. “The comparison that’s relevant,” he said, “is between men and women and Wal-Mart.”The chief justice also asked Mr. Sellers “how many examples of abuse of the subjective discrimination delegation need to be shown before you can say that flows from the policy rather than from bad actors?”Mr. Sellers responded that “there is no minimum number” in court decisions.Justices Kennedy and Samuel A. Alito Jr. said they were concerned about companies whose pay and promotion gaps mirror national numbers where there is no proof of a discriminatory policy.“So, you have the company that is absolutely typical of the entire American work force,” Justice Alito said.“That could very well be the case,” Mr. Sellers said.",center
"In an appeal to hard-right conservatives, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas is broadcasting a new campaign ad that seems to contrast Christianity with homosexuality, vows to end what he calls “Obama’s war on religion,” and highlights Mr. Perry’s criticism of overturning the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy for gays serving in the military.“I’m not ashamed to admit that I’m a Christian,” Mr. Perry says in the ad, “but you don’t need to be in the pew every Sunday to know there’s something wrong in this country when gays can serve openly in the military but our kids can’t openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school.”The Perry campaign did not say where the ad would run, but the focus of Mr. Perry’s multimillion-dollar television budget has been in Iowa, where large numbers of Republican caucusgoers describe themselves as Christian evangelicals.The new ad follows Mr. Perry’s statement on Tuesday criticizing the Obama administration’s announcement that the United States would use all the elements of diplomacy, including the possible granting of foreign aid, to promote gay rights around the world and beat back efforts in other nations to criminalize homosexual conduct.“As president, I’ll end Obama’s war on religion,” Mr. Perry also says in the ad.The Perry ad was denounced by the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay men and lesbian group, which said it was “wrong for Governor Perry to assume being a person of faith does not afford one to support equality.”R. Clarke Cooper, the group’s executive director, said, “Governor Perry is running to be commander-in-chief, not theocrat-in-chief.”He added, “Our nation was built upon individual liberty and individual responsibility, and open service by gay and lesbian servicemembers is directly in line with the vision of our founding fathers.”",conservative

"AMHERST, N.H. — Gov. Rick Perry of Texas on Tuesday said he would back a federal policy “to detain and to deport every illegal alien that we apprehend.”Mr. Perry, in his most expansive comments about illegal immigration since last week’s Republican presidential debate, was not suggesting any rounding up of illegal immigrants, an aide later made clear, but calling for all people arrested or detained — and later found to be undocumented — to be expelled from the country after an expedited hearing.The candidate sought to draw a contrast with the Obama administration, which he criticized as having a “catch-and-release” policy that allows some nonviolent illegal immigrants to be released back into the general public.It’s a “horrific policy,” Mr. Perry said.Backers of the policy say it allows officials to focus resources on deporting illegal immigrants who have been convicted of serious crimes or who are a threat to the public safety or the national interest.With a little more than a month to go before the New Hampshire primary, the Texas governor is trying to shore up his credentials on immigration: On Tuesday he won an endorsement from one of the nation’s most outspoken and controversial public officials on that issue: Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Ariz., who unabashedly calls himself the “toughest sheriff” in the country.Appearing at Joey’s Diner here, in the southern end of the state, Mr. Arpaio, who had also been courted by Representative Michele Bachmann and Herman Cain, praised what he called Mr. Perry’s efforts to interdict illegal crossings by sending Texas Rangers and other state law enforcement to the Texas border with Mexico.“He doesn’t just talk about it; he does something about it,” Mr. Arpaio said.Mr. Perry was widely criticized within his own party for backing a state plan that gives some children of illegal immigrants the same lower-cost in-state college tuition that is enjoyed by American citizens who attend the state’s public universities and who have been Texas residents at least three years.At one point he suggested that those who opposed his position were heartless.But it remains to be seen how much an endorsement from Sheriff Arpaio will help him in this state, where Mr. Perry is polling far behind the leader, Mitt Romney.Mr. Arpaio is also a polarizing figure.The sheriff has called the Justice Department’s action an attempt to intimidate him and he has said he does not engage in racial profiling.Even so, there are signs that the state’s aggressive immigration policies have begun to turn off some: Earlier this month a longtime Arpaio ally, Arizona State Sen. Russell Pearce, was defeated in a recall election by a more moderate Republican.The Justice Department is fighting the law, which has not taken effect yet.",center
"Setting the tone for the 112th Congress — in which every House bill must cite the constitutional source of its authority — members of the House of Representatives began to read the United States Constitution aloud from the chamber’s floor on Thursday morning.Like the Constitutional Convention itself, things did not begin auspiciously.Before the reading began, Jay Inslee, Democrat of Washington, asked Republicans to illuminate exactly what part of the Constitution would be read, what parts would be deleted and who would decide how things would unfold.It was decided in advance that any portion of the Constitution that was superseded by amendments — including the amendments themselves — would not be read, preventing lawmakers from having to make references to slaves, referred to in Article 1, Section 2 as “three fifths of all other persons,” or to things like prohibition.These inquiries about parliamentary procedure were not well received, and for several minutes, before a word of the preamble could be uttered, Democrats and Republicans battled back and forth over the issue of language, perhaps presaging future partisan battles over the meaning, purpose and application of the document.Once that was settled, just after 11 a.m., Representative John A. Boehner, the newly installed speaker of the House, read the preamble (that magical “We the people”), before yielding to the woman who handed him the gavel on Wednesday, Representative Nancy Pelosi, who picked up with Article 1, Section 1 (“All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives”), followed by Representative Eric Cantor, the House majority leader, and other House leaders.From there, members who wished to read were recognized from their seats, beginning with Representative Steve Rothman, Democrat of New Jersey.At one point, there was yelling in the chamber, and the sergeant-at-arms was called to remove a protester.The reading of the document on the floor of the House, an act that is part of the new rules package, serves several purposes, said Representative Robert W. Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia, who came up with the idea for the live reading.“Throughout the last year there has been a great debate about the expansion of the federal government, and lots of my constituents have said that Congress has gone beyond its powers granted in the Constitution,” said Mr. Goodlatte, a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over constitutional amendments.But it was also clearly meant as a nod to the Tea Party, a loosely organized political movement whose members cite the Constitution as the basis for much of their political theory concerning federal powers and the rights and responsibilities of Congress.The order of reading was ironed out at the last minute, with the goal of letting all who wished to read do so, but making sure there was party parity, Mr. Goodlatte said.According to the Office of the Historian of the House of Representatives, the only two prior instances in which a full or partial text of the Constitution was inserted into the Congressional Record was in 1882, when Roswell Flower of New York “appended” a text of the Constitution — minus the amendments — into the record, and in 1915, when Thomas Reilly of Connecticut inserted the full text of the Constitution into the Congressional Record as an extension of his remarks.",liberal

"WASHINGTON — Representative Anthony D. Weiner, trying to put to rest a bizarre episode that is overshadowing his role as liberal pugilist and threatening his dream of becoming New York’s mayor, emphatically denied on Wednesday that he had sent a suggestive photograph to a woman in Washington State but said he could not be sure that he is not the person in the image.“This was essentially a hacked account that had a gag photo sent out on it,” Mr. Weiner, a Democrat, said during an interview in his office here.On Tuesday, Mr. Weiner presided over two testy news briefings at which he had dodged a variety of questions.Mr. Weiner, one of Congress’s most enthusiastic users of social media to engage with constituents and supporters, said he believed his Twitter account, or a related photo-sharing site, had been infiltrated by a hacker or a prankster, who had then sent the offending photo out late Friday.He said that he had hired an Internet security company and a lawyer to look into the matter, but that he did not believe the episode merited investigation by federal law enforcement.He said he did not know the woman who received the photo, Gennette Cordova, a student at Whatcom Community College in Bellingham, Wash.; she followed him on Twitter.“I just feel terrible for her,” Mr. Weiner said, adding that he had never corresponded with her.The congressman also expressed concern about the toll the episode was taking on his wife, Huma Abedin, a longtime aide to Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.Asked on CNN whether he still wished to be mayor, he said, “Put it this way: It’s the only better job than the one I have.”Jack Levin, the chief executive of yFrog, the Twitter-affiliated image and video service that was used to upload the photo, said in an interview on Wednesday that his company did not have reason to believe that its user passwords were exposed or stolen.Mr. Levin said neither Mr. Weiner’s office nor any law enforcement authorities had contacted him or his company to inquire about the photo.Twitter, which does not comment on individual user accounts for privacy reasons, has declined to say whether Mr. Weiner’s account was hacked.Despite the swirl of events that has buffeted him for several days, Mr. Weiner has not abandoned his sharp humor.“I don’t have memory of this photograph,” Mr. Weiner said in the interview in his office.He paused, then added: “But I don’t know that.",center
"WASHINGTON -- The nation's leading advocate for senior citizens says that it hasn't wavered in its opposition to cutting Social Security benefits, though a top official with the group said it is open to a discussion about raising the retirement age and other changes.The Wall Street Journal reported Friday morning that AARP, one of the most influential lobbying groups in Washington, was softening its opposition to cutting retirement benefits.AARP initially pushed back against the newspaper's story.""Stay tuned -- our position has not changed on Social Security,"" an AARP spokeswoman said in an email to HuffPost.AARP legislative policy director David Certner said on CNN Friday that ""there was some miscommunication with the Wall Street Journal story.""But then Certner acknowledged that AARP believes the program needs to be changed.""Everybody knows we need to look at a package of different changes to Social Security to make it strong for the long term,"" he said.He suggested raising the age at which retirees can receive full benefits -- currently, 66 years old -- would be on the table even though doing so represents ""a massive benefit cut for people.""The 37 million-member lobbying powerhouse launched a national ad campaign Thursday warning members of Congress not to reduce benefits for recipients of Social Security and Medicare.Jonathan Cowan, president of centrist think tank Third Way, hailed AARP's apparent reversal, per the Journal story.""Today marks a watershed moment in American politics,"" Cowan said.Yet AARP reassured labor groups that it had not changed its position on Social Security, labor officials told HuffPost.""The AARP has a history of division between the top folks and their base on these issues.The official said that he and other opponents of benefit cuts had been told that AARP's ""longstanding position"" hadn't changed, but there was some uncertainty about what that position actually is.If AARP is open to reducing benefits, it would be a major boost for Social Security reformers who say the program is too generous and therefore unaffordable.Social Security will start paying out more in benefits than it absorbs in taxes this year which will lead the retirement program's trust fund to become exhausted in 2036, according to the latest annual trustees report.As of April, 35 million seniors received Social Security retirement benefits averaging $1,179 a month, according to the program's latest monthly snapshot.Economists credit the program for drastically reducing poverty among the elderly since its creation in the 1930s.The Journal reported that AARP policy chief John Rother is pushing the organization to accept benefit cuts as part of a deal to make Social Security solvent.Social Security's retirement benefits are funded with taxes on incomes up to $106,800, known as the taxable earnings base.A September 2010 Congressional Research Service report found that lifting the cap, without also raising benefits, would make the program solvent for the foreseeable future.""If all earnings were subject to the payroll tax, but the base was retained for benefit calculations, the Social Security Trust Funds would remain solvent for the next 75 years,"" said the report.""There are dozens of ways modest tax increases on even just the very wealthiest Americans would restore Social Security to long-run actuarial balance, and there would be enough left over to increase benefits,"" said Nancy Altman, co-chair of Strengthen Social Security, a 300-member coalition of national and state organizations opposed to benefit cuts.The problem with plans to hike taxes is that they're politically unfeasible because of congressional Republicans' adamant opposition to any sort of tax increase, much less a tax increase not accompanied by a spending cut.UPDATE: AARP CEO A. Barry Rand said in a statement, ""It has long been AARP's policy that Social Security should be strengthened to provide adequate benefits and that it is sufficiently financed to ensure solvency with a stable trust fund for the next 75 years.""",center

"WASHINGTON — AARP, the powerful lobby for older Americans that has been seen as one of the leading opponents of Social Security benefit cuts, said on Friday that it was open to modest reductions in benefits for future recipients.The group’s stance, which generated quick reaction from all sides because of its powerful voice on the issue, could provide added ammunition to fiscal conservatives who have sought unsuccessfully to restructure Social Security and chip away at the benefits it promises older Americans.“Our goal is to limit any changes in benefits,” John Rother, AARP’s policy chief, said in a telephone interview, “but we also want to see the system made solvent.”Mr. Rother said the group’s stance on possible cuts, which was first reported in The Wall Street Journal in Friday’s editions, should be seen less as a major change in position than as a reflection of the political and financial realities facing the Social Security system and the country as a whole.“You have to look at all the tradeoffs,” Mr. Rother said, “and what we’re trying to do is engage the American public in that debate.”He made clear that the group’s willingness to discuss cuts comes with conditions: Reductions in benefits should be “minimal,” they should not affect current recipients and instead should be directed “far off in the future,” and they should be offset by increases in tax-generated revenue.Nonetheless, the group’s openness to the possibility of unspecified cuts was seen as a significant development by people on all sides of the Social Security question because of AARP’s influence on federal policies affecting older Americans, including Medicare, prescription drugs and many more.Third Way, a moderate Democratic group in Washington that has favored possible reductions in benefits, called AARP’s position “a watershed moment” in the debate over Social Security.“Now that they have opened the door to reform, it is time for lawmakers to walk through it,” said Jonathan Cowan, president of Third Way.But other advocacy groups that are pushing to preserve Social Security benefits accused AARP of effectively abandoning its core constituency.Max Richtman, executive vice president of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy group in Washington, said the timing of AARP’s statements was particularly bad because it came in the midst of deliberations between the Obama administration and Congressional Republicans about the debt ceiling and overall deficit reduction.AARP insisted that the Social Security trust funds should not be raided to reduce the deficit and that the two issues were separate.“I think it’s tragic that AARP would, wittingly or unwittingly, play into the hands of people who have never really liked Social Security and want to decimate it,” Mr. Richtman said.Republican leaders, who have led calls for revamping Social Security, had no immediate comments on AARP’s willingness to consider benefit reductions.An aide to the Republican-led House Ways and Means Committee, who spoke on condition of anonymity under committee protocol, said AARP’s position was a welcome acknowledgment that Social Security would be unable to pay future benefits at the current rate and that it must be restructured.“The longer we wait,” the aide said, “the more difficult it will be to protect current beneficiaries and those who rely on Social Security the most.”The most recent projections from the Social Security Administration, issued last month, indicate that at the current rate, the program’s trust funds will be exhausted by 2036, and that $6.5 trillion in additional money will be needed over a 75-year period to pay all scheduled benefits.Mr. Rother said AARP expected to hear criticism from some of its members over its position on possible cuts.“We have such a broad membership, Mr. Rother said.While AARP has not issued specific recommendations or figures on how benefit reductions might be carried out, the group’s recent discussions with its members signal support for using increased revenue to fill two-thirds of the projected gap, and benefits reductions for one-third, Mr. Rother said.As word of AARP’s position set off debate in Washington on Friday, the group’s chief executive, Barry Rand, issued a formal statement saying that the group’s position had not changed in any substantive way and refuting what he described as “misleading” media reports.“Let me be clear — AARP is as committed as we’ve ever been to fighting to protect Social Security for today’s seniors and strengthening it for future generations,” Mr. Rand said.While he did not directly address the question of possible cuts in benefits in his statement, Mr. Rand said his group would be working to evaluate any proposed changes in Social Security “to determine how each might — individually or in different combinations — impact the lives of current and future retirees.”",liberal
"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court appears ready to block a massive sex discrimination lawsuit against Wal-Mart on behalf of up to 1.6 million women, and that could make it harder for other workers nationwide to bring class-action claims against large employers.The 10-year-old lawsuit, argued in lively exchanges at the court Tuesday, claims that Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world's largest employer, favors men over women in pay and promotions.The case also could affect the future of other class-action lawsuits that pool modest individual claims into a single action that creates the potential for a large judgment and increases the pressure on businesses to settle.In Tuesday's arguments, several justices suggested they were troubled by the case and lower court decisions against Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart.Justice Anthony Kennedy, often a key vote on the high court, said the women's argument points in apparently conflicting directions.""You said this is a culture where Arkansas knows, the headquarters knows, everything that's going on,"" Kennedy said to Joseph Sellers, the women's lawyer.Sellers said that lower courts had been persuaded by statistical and other evidence put forth so far in the lawsuit.""The decisions are informed by the values the company provides,"" Sellers said.Justice Antonin Scalia said he felt ""whipsawed"" by Sellers' description.Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said that at this stage of the lawsuit, the issue is not proving discrimination but showing enough evidence to go forward.Ginsburg, who made her name as a lawyer by bringing discrimination claims, said it was possible that Wal-Mart could refute the claims at a trial.The court's other two female justices, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, and Justice Stephen Breyer also appeared inclined to allow the lawsuit to proceed.But several of their more conservative colleagues appeared to agree with Theodore Boutrous Jr., representing Wal-Mart, that even subjecting the company to a trial would be unfair.That split among the justices raised the prospect of an ideologically divided ruling by the court this summer.Boutrous said the class-action nature of the case deprives the company of its legal rights because it is being forced to defend the treatment of female employees regardless of the jobs they hold or where they work.""There is absolutely no way there can be a fair process here,"" Boutrous said.He pointed to a group of at least 544 women who serve as store managers who ""are alleged to be both discriminators and victims.""Two of the named plaintiffs, Christine Kwapnoski and Betty Dukes, attended the argument.Their situations were discussed only briefly, with Boutrous noting how different they were as a way to argue they should not be dealt with in the same lawsuit.Business interests have lined up with Wal-Mart while civil rights, women's and consumer groups have sided with the women plaintiffs.Both sides have painted the case as extremely consequential.David Sanford, who represents plaintiffs in other class-action cases, said after the arguments that the court seemed inclined to rule against the Wal-Mart women.The Obama administration is not taking part in the case, although it was lobbied by both sides.",center
"Even for a Congress known to battle over every little detail, reading the U.S. Constitution aloud sounded like a simple exercise.Turned out it wasn't.Newly sworn members of the House reading aloud the country's founding document on Thursday didn't recite every verse and article of the document because Republicans decided that the obsolete parts can be skipped since they've been superseded by amendment.For instance, lawmakers did not read the 18th Amendment, which imposed prohibition on liquor in 1919.Republicans also left out the part about counting slaves and Native Americans as three-fifths of a person.Portions of the U.S. Constitution are never deleted, just amended, as has been done 27 times in history.And that was the point of contention for Democratic lawmakers who complained that exempting parts of the document from the reading undermines the objective of the exercise.""This is very emotional for me,"" Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., D-Ill., said on the floor before the reading began.""Given the struggle of African Americans, given the struggle of women, given the struggle of others to create a more perfect document, to hear that those elements of the Constitution that have been dedacted (sic) by amendment are no less serious, no less part of our ongoing struggle to improve the country and our desire to continue to improve the Constitution, many of us don't want that to be lost upon the reading of our sacred document,"" he said.Rep.

Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., who presided over the reading.Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., questioned the reading of the ""amended"" Constitution.""To not read the full document, including all the text that was later amended, is to fail to acknowledge the struggle our nation has constantly fought, within and without, to 'keep' our Republic,"" he said in a written statement.""It is a failure to show Americans that while we seek a more perfect union, we do so from imperfect beginnings, through an imperfect history, with an imperfect government created by an imperfect document,"" he added.Other lawmakers decried the exercise altogether, saying the Constitution is a living document that shouldn't be followed to the letter.""They are reading it like a sacred text,"" Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., the former chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, told The Washington Post.Nadler derided what he called the ""ritualistic reading"" as ""total nonsense"" and ""propaganda"" intended to give Republicans claim to the document.""You are not supposed to worship your Constitution,"" he told the newspaper.But for all those who described the exercise as political waste -- including Vanity Fair magazine, which estimated it as costing more than $1 million -- supporters noted that it was an historic moment -- the first time the U.S. Constitution had been read on the U.S. House floor.""I think that this is a very symbolic showing to the American people and reminder to the members of congress that we are a government of laws not of men and that this Constitution is the foundation for all of our laws,"" Goodlatte said.And backers said that it wouldn't hurt to try to live by the aspirations of the Founding Fathers.""I don't think the Constitution is propaganda.Historian Alan Brinkley of Columbia University told Fox News the reading may be ""a bit of theater,"" but it is ""not insignificant given that many Republicans have decided -- implausibly, in my opinion -- that the Constitution is the vehicle that can reduce the size of government.""But Roger Pilon of the Cato Institute said Congress needs to re-read the Constitution to be reminded how out of control government has become.""Today the Congress regulates our lives and redistributes our wealth in ways that would shock the Founders,"" he said.Pilon added that the Founders never intended for the Constitution to be viewed as fluid advice.""When liberals tell today that the Constitution is essentially a blank slate to be filled by transient majorities, nothing could be further from the truth.As the Constitution was being read inside the lower chamber, Nadler and others gathered outside the Capitol to push for passage of the Equal Rights Amendment, a perennial effort to update the document with a statement on women.""John Boehner and his cronies are holding up the U.S. Constitution as a sacred, perfect document.",center
"Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his tough and controversial stances on illegal immigration, endorsed three term Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination on Tuesday morning during a campaign swing with Mr. Perry through New Hampshire.The self-titled America's Toughest Sheriff, who famously re-instituted chain gangs in 1995 and has also been a major supporter of his state's controversial SB1070 immigration law, said that Perry has done more to combat illegal immigration along the U.S. border then any of the other candidates.""I'm endorsing Rick Perry because we need a tough-on-crime president who will champion and fund full-time border security operations from Brownsville to San Diego,"" Arpaio said.""Sheriff Arpaio knows the struggle border states face as Washington politicians and bureaucrats fail time and again to properly secure our nation's southern boundary with Mexico,"" said Gov.

"President Obama on Wednesday visited another bridge in need of repair – this one somewhat closer to home, between Washington and Virginia — to promote his job-creation proposals as the Senate began the latest partisan debate over his plans.But in pressing for approval of $60 billion in infrastructure spending, Mr. Obama took his biggest shot not at the measure’s Republican opponents in the Senate, but at those in the House.“I trust in God,” Mr. Obama said, “but God wants to see us help ourselves by putting people back to work!”Invoking patriotism as well as divine intervention – Mr. Obama stood against the backdrop of a giant American flag – he spoke before an audience that included unemployed construction workers, whose industry is among the hardest hit by the housing bust.“I’m joining many of these workers to say that it makes absolutely no sense when there’s so much work to be done that they’re not doing the work,” Mr. Obama said to their applause.The president’s short trip from the White House to the event stage on the Potomac riverfront came more than a month after he began campaigning throughout the country for his jobs plan, building public pressure on Republicans but winning no votes from them.Mr. Obama said the two leaders and other Republicans had supported public-works investments in the past.For the same reason, some leading business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Associated General Contractors of America, have withdrawn support for the infrastructure spending bill, though Mr. Obama cited the Chamber as a supporter in his remarks.The House has declined to take up Mr. Obama’s jobs package, while Senate Democrats could not muster the 60 votes needed to block a Republican filibuster against either the full $447 billion package or a $35 billion piece providing state aid, mostly for teachers’ pay.“The American people are with me with this,” Mr. Obama said.The outcome in the Senate on the infrastructure spending provision, however, is not expected to be any different from the previous two votes.Mr. Obama’s transportation secretary, Ray LaHood, a former Republican congressman from Illinois, appeared with him at the Key Bridge and then went to the Capitol to meet with lawmakers.In response to Mr. Obama, House Republicans said the Democratic-controlled Senate should take up some 16 House-passed measures; most would attack federal regulations or spending and would have long-term impact, analysts say, but they would not spur job creation in the coming year or two.Mr. Boehner facetiously said that Mr. Obama, as a former Democratic senator, could help: “I’m sure he has great influence over there in terms of getting them to take up these bills that really will help put the American people back to work.”",center

"Donald Trump is investing more in the conspiracy theories about President Obama’s birth certificate as he explores his own bid for the presidency.In his latest embrace of the birther strategy, Mr. Trump has invited Tea Party leaders and a legislator from Arizona to his office in Manhattan on Friday morning to discuss a bill moving through the Arizona legislature that would require candidates for president to prove that they are natural born citizens.The Arizona group said the call from Mr. Trump on Wednesday came unexpectedly, and the group had spent much of the day Thursday scurrying to make travel arrangements to New York.“Of course I was surprised, who wouldn’t be?” said the legislator, Representative Carl Seel.In an interview shown Thursday on the “Today” show, Mr. Trump told Meredith Vieira that he had “real doubts” about whether Mr. Obama was born in this country, and that he has sent his own investigators to Hawaii to research the issue.Mr. Obama has shown a certificate of live birth from Hawaii, which is the standard form of birth certificate in the state, and state officials – including the Republican who was governor during the 2008 campaign – have confirmed its authenticity.But polls show that many Republicans continue to believe that Mr. Obama was not born in this country, and therefore is not eligible to be president.Kelly Townsend, a founder of the Greater Phoenix Tea Party, said Mr. Trump told them that he was interested in learning more about the legislation in Arizona.The bill, which has been approved by committees of the House and Senate, allows great latitude to the secretary of state in denying a presidential candidate a spot on the ballot, saying that the secretary can do so if he or she believes that the documents do not prove citizenship.“It’s not a birther bill,” Ms. Townsend said.But a release from Mr. Seel’s office about the planned meeting noted that Mr. Trump “has brought the issue of President Barack Obama failing to provide a birth certificate front and center recently.”Ms. Townsend said she had her own agenda for the meeting at Trump Tower.",liberal

"The AARP pushed back Friday on a report claiming the nation's most powerful seniors lobby was dropping its opposition to benefits cuts -- but at the same time acknowledged ""benefit adjustments"" would be necessary to make the system solvent.The flurry of reports and statements left unclear whether AARP was opening up to new concessions in the debate over Social Security, as several lawmakers place reform proposals on the table.The Wall Street Journal first reported Friday that the AARP, which opposed President George W. Bush's push to partially privatize Social Security, has decided to accept cuts -- though it would reportedly push for tax hikes to close most of the long-term Social Security shortfall.AARP CEO Barry Rand later issued a statement calling the article ""misleading"" and claiming ""AARP has not changed its position on Social Security.""He said AARP remains opposed to cutting Social Security for the sake of deficit reduction and to any privatization plan.However, AARP legislative policy director David Certner told Fox News that Social Security needs a ""package of revenue and benefit adjustments ... to make it solvent.""While the AARP claims its position on strengthening Social Security remains unchanged, others outside the organization detected a shift.Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, who on Thursday unveiled her own Social Security reform package, said Friday that the AARP has marked ""a huge shift in the debate on the solvency of Social Security.""""AARP's new and welcome position is a positive step towards the type of reforms I've championed, and I look forward to working with the organization to shape the changes in a way that makes the least detrimental impact to present and future retirees,"" she said in a statement.There is still plenty of space between the kind of plan Hutchison is calling for and what groups like the AARP would accept.Hutchison's plan does not include tax hikes.""Those two things would keep our Social Security system solvent for 75 years with really, I think, minor pain and a big gain,"" she told Fox News on Thursday.But the AARP has told Fox News that Hutchison's proposal is not acceptable.Asked about the possibility of Social Security entering budget talks at some point, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney reiterated past statements in saying President Obama does not see Social Security as a ""driver"" of the country's near-term deficits.""The president supports measures to strengthen Social Security, but he does not support anything that would slash benefits for future generations,"" Carney said Friday.The back-and-forth comes amid new warnings about the future of Social Security.But the president's budget director told Fox News that even when the trust funds run out, both Social Security and Medicare would still have some income.""We have a little bit of time,"" said Jack Lew, director of the Office of Management and Budget.With AARP potentially backing off its opposition, other groups are poised to take up the fight.",center
"A pending class action lawsuit against Wal-Mart that would be the largest of its kind in U.S. history may soon be dismissed, considering the tenor of oral arguments before the Supreme Court Tuesday.Although she may ultimately side with the plaintiffs, even Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, an ardent defender of women's rights, expressed some concerns about the particulars of the sex discrimination lawsuit that covers 1.5 million women and could cost the world's largest retailer billions of dollars.The key vote for a Wal-Mart victory could belong to Justice Anthony Kennedy, who said he was troubled by what he called an inconsistency in the women's lawsuit.""Number one, you said this is a culture where Arkansas knows, the headquarters knows, everything that's going on,"" Kennedy told lawyer Joseph Sellers who represents the women.The lawsuit alleges that the company's corporate culture, described in court Tuesday as the ""Wal-Mart Way,"" fosters the advancement of male workers over their female counterparts.This dual argument that confounded Justice Kennedy also drew the ire of Justice Antonin Scalia who said he was whipsawed by the claims.Chief Justice John Roberts also offered his doubts about the merits of lawsuit, suggesting that any discriminatory acts at Wal-Mart are no worse than anywhere else.""Is it true that Wal-Mart's pay disparity across the company was less than the national average?"" he asked.Sellers said that wasn't a fair comparison because Wal-Mart has an obligation under federal law to make sure its managers do not discriminate.The case started a decade ago when Wal-Mart worker Betty Dukes said the management at her Pittsburg, Calif., store was bypassing her for promotions.Her discrimination claims were folded into a class action lawsuit covering all current female Wal-Mart employees and any who worked for the company going back to late 1998.On Tuesday, Dukes walked out of the courthouse full of confidence and poise saying she feels no anger toward her bosses or anyone else.But they are not big enough where they can't be challenged in a court of law.Dukes's case has drawn the attention of the larger business community who fear that if the justices allow the case to proceed, it will open the doors to more class action lawsuits.Much of the hour-long argument delved into the tedious details of class action law and if the Wal-Mart women could properly certify their claims into a single case.""Our expert's report and testimony showed that at 90 percent of the stores, there was no pay disparity,"" Boutrous told the court.Another technical concern that appears to work against the women covers the different types of remedies they are seeking.It's possible that instead of an outright victory for Wal-Mart, the justices could issue a split decision of sorts and allow only the injunction part of the lawsuit to move forward.",center

"WASHINGTON — The tableau at the White House was chillingly familiar: The somber president, nearing the end of his eight-year term, walked grim-faced to the podium to offer his condolences, promised action in the wake of suffering and pleaded for a new resolve that just might prevent more deaths in a hail of bullets.The list of tragedies on President Obama’s watch seems countless by now.“We have to decide if that’s the kind of country we want to be,” Mr. Obama said on Sunday as he mourned the nation’s deadliest mass shooting.Mr. Obama vowed to respond forcefully to what he called a devastating “act of terror and an act of hate.”In his remarks, Mr. Obama said it was still unclear to the authorities whether there was a direct link between the gunman and international terrorist groups.It took only hours for questions about those connections to become fodder in the presidential campaign.“If we do not get tough and smart real fast, we are not going to have a country anymore,” Mr. Trump said in a statement.Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, called the massacre in Orlando, Fla., an “act of terror” and an “act of hate” and called for “hardening our defenses at home” while “refusing to be intimidated and staying true to our values” in the United States.Mr. Obama pleaded with Americans during his remarks not to “give in to fear or turn against each other,” a somewhat muted reference to Mr. Trump’s previous call for a ban on Muslims entering the United States.“In the face of hate and violence, we will love one another,” Mr. Obama said.Speaking to reporters, Mr. Obama said the country had again been traumatized by grievous violence, which shattered more than 100 lives during a three-hour nightmare early Sunday, with 50 people killed and 53 wounded in the attack.During his presidency, Mr. Obama has repeatedly mourned victims of mass shootings, often expressing anger and frustration at what he has said is the country’s apparent willingness to let them become a “normal” part of life.That anger has been compounded by Mr. Obama’s inability to persuade lawmakers to impose new restrictions on the availability of firearms, especially the assault-style rifles like the one believed to have been used by the gunman in Sunday morning’s attack in Orlando.“Can we say that we’re truly doing enough to give all the children of this country the chance they deserve to live out their lives in happiness and with purpose?” an emotional Mr. Obama said after the Newtown attack.Mr. Obama on Sunday gave his deepest condolences to the families of the victims, and he said Americans should, in particular, keep the country’s gay and lesbian community in mind as they offer their prayers.“The shooter targeted a nightclub where people came together to be with friends, to dance and to sing, and to live,” Mr. Obama said.Mr. Obama has often hailed the progress on gay rights that has been made during his presidency, especially the decision by the United States Supreme Court to allow same-sex marriage.“This is a sobering reminder that attacks on any American — regardless of race, ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation — is an attack on all of us and on the fundamental values of equality and dignity that define us as a country,” he said.Mr. Obama took no questions from reporters after delivering his five-minute remarks.Shortly after he spoke, Mr. Obama ordered that flags at the White House and other federal sites around the world be lowered to half-staff.

Chris Christie of New Jersey and Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker.Mr. Trump said his decision was largely coming down to instinct.He also suggested that he would consider polling in states like heavily Democratic Connecticut, which he again said he believed he could put in play in November.Asked for quick thoughts about each of the candidates he is known to be considering, Mr. Trump played along.Governor Christie? “Strong,” he said.Retired Lt.

Trump from becoming president — and would work closely with Hillary Clinton to make that happen.After the meeting with Mr. Obama, which lasted more than an hour, Mr. Sanders gave no indication that he was ready to leave the race just yet, insisting that he would compete in next week’s primary contest here in Washington.“I will work as hard as I can, to make sure that Donald Trump does not become president of the United States,” Mr. Sanders told reporters, saying the Manhattan businessman “makes bigotry and discrimination the cornerstone of his campaign” and would be a “disaster” as commander in chief.He said he would continue fighting for the issues that animated his campaign, including enhancing Social Security benefits, college affordability and restoring the nation’s crumbling infrastructure.“These are the issues that we will take to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia in July,” Mr. Sanders said, declining to answer reporters’ shouted questions about whether he would leave the race.Shortly after their meeting, Mr. Obama endorsed Mrs. Clinton in a video.The visit came a day after the senator huddled with his team at his headquarters in Vermont to discuss the fate of his candidacy.Mr. Sanders, who requested the meeting with the president, pulled into the White House grounds at 10:56 a.m. after stopping at a nearby Peet’s Coffee for a scone.Mr. Obama was trying to negotiate, however gently, with him to exit the Democratic race without inflicting damage on efforts to unite the party.“My hope is, is that over the next couple of weeks, we’re able to pull things together,” Mr. Obama said during a taping of an appearance on the “Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” on Wednesday in New York.Briefly posing for photographers before his meeting in the Capitol with Senator Harry Reid, the minority leader, Mr. Sanders ignored three questions about Mr. Obama’s endorsement of Mrs. Clinton.His face flushed, Mr. Sanders did not speak at all.After his meeting with Reid, Mr. Sanders made a quick exit through a back hall on his way to meet with Senator Chuck Schumer of New York.After Mrs. Clinton won Tuesday’s California primary, Mr. Sanders refused to quit the race, despite Mrs. Clinton’s wide margin of victory and the fact that she had the support of enough delegates for the nomination.On Wednesday, Mr. Sanders sent out a fund-raising email asking for contributions of $2.70, and at 7 p.m. he will hold a rally outside of R.F.K. Stadium in Washington, where he will discuss his plans for getting big money out of politics and making public universities tuition free.",center
"Controversial Maine Gov. Paul LePage opened the door Tuesday to making an early exit from the governor’s office following pressure from state lawmakers to step down.“I’m looking at all options,” LePage said on talk radio station WVOM.Later in the day, LePage took to Twitter, though, to push back on media reports about a possible resignation.During the radio interview, the governor apologized repeatedly for an expletive-ridden voicemail he recently left for Democratic state Rep. Drew Gattine -- the latest controversy to hang over his office.Earlier, the Republican governor had refused to apologize for the message, even saying at press conference he wished it was 1825 so he could shoot Gattine in a duel.In a recording of the message obtained by the Press Herald, the governor identified himself and went on to curse out Gattine.“I would like to talk to you about your comments about my being a racist, you c---sucker.LePage initially said his outburst was justified because Gattine called him a racist – something Gattine has denied.The alleged name-calling came after LePage said during a town hall that he’s collected a binder full of drug dealers arrested in the state showing that 90 percent of them “are black and Hispanic people from Waterbury, Conn.; the Bronx; and Brooklyn.”The leaked voicemail prompted members of LePage’s own party to question his ability to lead the state.During his news conference Friday, LePage offered more racially charged comments that have drawn fire, saying, ""A bad guy is a bad guy.But this isn’t the first time LePage’s comments have gotten him in trouble.The Republican governor has a long history of making controversial statements dating back to 2010 when he said if he were elected governor, he’d tell President Obama to “go to hell.”A year later, LePage said that NAACP officials, who had called him out for not attending a Martin Luther King Jr.’s event, could “kiss my butt.”In 2015, LePage was forced to apologize to the son of a cartoonist for The Bangor Daily News because he told him he’d “like to shoot” his father.In January, he said drug dealers with names like “D-Money, Smoothie (and) Shifty” are getting Maine’s white women pregnant.LePage’s second and final term as governor officially ends in 2019.",liberal
"Sen. Ted Cruz has laid down the gauntlet in the growing war of words with Donald Trump over the Republican presidential candidates’ wives.The Texas lawmaker blamed his rival for the National Enquirer story published Friday that alleged Cruz has had extramarital affairs, and after hits from Trump’s campaign about the mental health of his wife, the firebrand senator appears to be backing away from his pledge to support Trump if the billionaire real estate mogul wins the GOP nomination.“I don’t make a habit out of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my family,” Cruz said at a press conference after a Wisconsin rally, according to The Hill.He added, “Donald Trump is not going to be the Republican nominee.”Earlier in the campaign, GOP candidates signed a promise not to run as an independent if they were not nominated.“It is garbage, complete and utter lies,” Cruz said about the National Enquirer article alleging that he has had multiple affairs.Trump spokeswoman Katrina Pierson responded to claims that she is one of the mystery women referred to in the article, stating on Twitter that the allegation is “stupidity on all levels.”“Of course the National Enquirer story is 100 percent false!,” Pierson tweeted.Of course the National Enquirer story is 100% FALSE!!!Earlier this year, the tabloid endorsed Trump for president with an issue that included an article giving ten reasons why the reality TV star is the “only choice for the White House.”The intensely personal feud between Cruz and Trump began earlier this week when a super PAC that opposes Trump posted a meme-style ad featuring a naked Melania Trump that Trump’s then-girlfriend, a professional model, posed for more that 15 years ago for British GQ.Make America Awesome PAC paid for the ads and posted them on Facebook and Instagram.The photo features Mrs. Trump sprawled out naked on a fur rug inside a Boeing 727.An angry Trump lashed out at Cruz on Twitter, calling the senator a liar, as he has alleged before in the campaign, and threatening to “spill the beans” about Cruz's wife Heidi.“Lyin' Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a GQ shoot in his ad,” Trump said on the social media site.Cruz quickly retorted by saying that the ads did not come not from his campaign, and called Trump a “coward” threatening to go after his wife.“Pic of your wife not from us,” Cruz said.The lurch into the sort of personal territory that's normally off limits in campaigns occurred as an anti-Trump super PAC began running an ad in primary states featuring women reciting comments made by the billionaire that are derogatory toward women.Trump has a substantial lead in the delegate chase for the GOP nomination.",conservative
"Former Mexican President Vicente Fox says Mexico will not pay for a wall along the U.S. border, despite what GOP presidential hopeful Donald Trump may claim.Fox said, as a taxpayer, he’s not willing to fund Trump’s big idea.“I’m not going to pay for that fucking wall,” Fox told Fusion’s Jorge Ramos in an interview airing Thursday.The GOP front-runner, who has made many outrageous comments about Latinos including calling Mexican immigrants ""criminals"" and ""rapists,"" insists he'll coerce Mexico into paying for a wall to keep undocumented migrants out of the U.S. if he's elected.Fox, however, isn't worried that Trump will actually win the presidency.""Democracy cannot pick crazy people that doesn't know what's going on in the world today,"" he said.Ramos pointed out that Trump likely won among Hispanics during Tuesday’s Nevada caucus -- a statistic that has a few caveats.""I'd like to know who those Hispanics are,"" Fox said.Felipe Calderon, who was president of Mexico from 2006 to 2012, has also dismissed Trump's idea.""Mexican people, we are not going to pay any single cent for such a stupid wall,"" he said earlier this month.",center
"Listening to Michael R. Bloomberg rage about Donald J. Trump in his speech at the Democratic National Convention this week — labeling him a public menace and hinting that he was not quite sane — it would be easy to think that the two billionaires had a rift going back many years.“Trump says he wants to run the nation like he’s run his business,” Mr. Bloomberg said on Wednesday.But in all their time in New York City, their interactions have been limited, yet cordial, according to people who know both of them.They existed in different circles of New York’s ultrarich: Mr. Bloomberg is known as a generous philanthropist; Mr. Trump appears to have been flinty in his giving.Mr. Bloomberg made his billions in finance and technology; Mr. Trump got his start in real estate before becoming a casino magnate and then a reality-show celebrity.“I’ve been by Mike’s side for 19 years, and I’ve never met Donald Trump,” said Kevin Sheekey, an adviser to Mr. Bloomberg, underscoring the extent to which the men were not close.On at least a few occasions, Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Trump met up on the golf links.“How about the mayor starts it off in honor of the city?” Mr. Trump was quoted as saying, playing peacemaker and showing deference to Mr. Bloomberg.Mr. Bloomberg also appeared twice on Mr. Trump’s reality TV show, “The Apprentice,” in 2004 and 2008, in part as a way to demonstrate support for the show, which was produced in New York.And the men have a filial connection: acquaintances said that Mr. Bloomberg’s daughter Georgina is friends with Mr. Trump’s daughter Ivanka.Mr. Trump, an avid user of Twitter, made positive comments about Mr. Bloomberg when he was in office.In 2013, he praised Mr. Bloomberg’s administration for choosing him to finish a stalled Bronx golf course project, and then wrote on Twitter about a ribbon-cutting with the mayor.In 2014, Mr. Trump tweeted congratulations at Georgina for winning an equestrian tournament.But the cordiality dissipated not long after Mr. Trump declared his candidacy.“As a former Republican presidential campaign manager told me, Hillary has some baggage, but Trump is crazy,” said Mr. Sheekey, who was involved in Mr. Bloomberg’s explorative bid.Mr. Trump, typically, has not shied away from counterattacks.“We used to be friends,” Mr. Trump told CNN.",center

"WASHINGTON ― House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) was re-elected to her leadership post Wednesday morning.Pelosi defeated her lone challenger, Rep. Tim Ryan (Ohio), by a vote of 134 to 63.“There’s a whole lot of anger,” said one Democrat who opposed her, who requested anonymity in order to speak freely.Pelosi has led House Democrats since 2003, and that’s what Ryan had argued is the problem.House Democrats have also lost nearly 60 seats over the past six years.Pelosi’s supporters said her experience is what the party needs now more than ever, going up against President-elect Donald Trump and a GOP-controlled Congress: She’s battle-tested, she’s a prolific fundraiser and she knows better than anyone how to count votes and keep her party together.They say it’s not her fault when Democrats lose at the polls, either.“You can’t really blame Nancy Pelosi for gerrymandering and for the national election,” Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) told reporters.She’s also the only woman in top House and Senate leadership.The California Democrat spoke briefly to reporters after the vote, saying she feels “exhilarated” at being re-elected.“Today has a special excitement for me because I think we’re at a time where it is well beyond politics.“We know how to win elections,” she added.Asked about the 63 Democrats who voted for Ryan, Pelosi said, “I got two-thirds of the vote.”Separately, Ryan told reporters the race didn’t turn out as he wanted but he thinks he did “a pretty good job” of bringing economic issues to the forefront.“I think we got the message out,” he said.During the closed-door caucus meeting, several Democrats went to bat for Pelosi. Reps. Adam Schiff (Calif.), Gwen Moore (Wis.), Bill Pascrell (N.J.), Katherine Clark (Mass.), Joaquin Castro (Texas) and Debbie Dingell (Mich.) each gave nominating speeches for her.“Everything we care about [is] at risk,” Schiff told the room.Dingell said she has spoken “endlessly” to Pelosi about appealing to Midwestern voters, and said she gets it.Pelosi’s understanding of Midwesterners, or lack thereof, is what Ryan highlighted as the party’s biggest problem.“When you see working-class people, blue-collar people, going and voting for Trump, that’s a failure of the Democratic Party because they felt like we didn’t care about them,” Ryan said earlier this month.Pelosi did not agree with Ryan’s assessment in a Monday interview with The Huffington Post.“He didn’t even carry his district for Hillary Clinton, so I don’t know why he’s saying that,” she said.",center
"AUGUSTA, Me. — Paul R. LePage, the embattled Republican governor of Maine, declared on Wednesday that he would not step down despite widespread criticism over a profane threat and generalizations about drugs and race that had prompted him to hint on Tuesday that he might abort his second term.“I will not resign,” said Mr. LePage, who tried to put to rest swirling questions about his state of mind.“I’m not an alcoholic, and I’m not a drug addict, and I don’t have mental issues,” he said.Mr. LePage nevertheless said he was seeking “spiritual guidance,” had apologized for his threat, and vowed to make one change to his behavior: “I will no longer speak to the press ever again after today,” he said.Behind the scenes, state lawmakers — Democrats and Senate Republicans — exasperated after six years of political controversies and what they saw as erratic behavior, were scrambling to figure out what, if anything, they could do to formally address this latest crisis.The controversy, which has galvanized the state, started last Wednesday when Mr. LePage made sweeping statements linking minorities to the state’s drug crisis.Both Democrats and Republicans have denounced the remarks, as many legislators called for a special session to at least rebuke the governor over his latest tirade.But on Tuesday, Mr. LePage’s Republican allies in the House, including the minority leader, Kenneth Fredette, announced that they would oppose those efforts — essentially shielding him from any official political consequence.That decision did not sit well with some other state Republicans, and on Wednesday morning, the spotlight shifted to them as the president of the Senate, whose members govern larger and more competitive districts, made a public break with his colleagues in the House.“With all due respect, I completely disagree with Representative Fredette’s position,” the Republican leader, Michael Thibodeau, said in a statement.Mr. Thibodeau said many Senate Republicans were still deciding whether or not Mr. LePage’s apology and promise to seek “spiritual guidance” had allayed their concerns about the governor — a process that could deepen their divide with Republicans in the House and pull the controversy into a second week.“There should be consequences for our actions,” Mr. Thibodeau said, “and I think that’s why we’re really struggling.”There is no precedent for such a situation here — a fact that has sent lawmakers like Senator Roger Katz, a Republican who has been critical of Mr. LePage, back to reading their state Constitutions on Wednesday to figure out what, if anything, they could do now to convene a special session.“It’s never been done before, so we’re in a little bit of uncharted waters,” said Mr. Katz, who said he wanted Mr. LePage to get “a competent evaluation and follow the recommendations of the evaluator.”Democrats have continued to call for Mr. LePage’s ouster, and on Wednesday said they were scheduling meetings with Republican leadership to discuss how to proceed.“Coming back in for a special session will be discussed and all options around the governor’s political future are on the table,” said the Democratic leader of the Senate, Justin Alfond.Mr. LePage’s six years in office here, which began as part of the Tea Party sweep in 2010, have been marked by controversy.By all indications, Mr. LePage seemed determined to again ride out the political storm.“I want to put this behind us,” Mr. LePage said, during a meeting with a select group of reporters in his office on Wednesday morning, adding, “I will never talk about it again.”Mr. LePage spoke shortly after he met with — and apologized to — Representative Drew Gattine, the state Democratic lawmaker who had been the recipient of the angry voice mail.But he but did not apologize for statements he made last week that linked trafficking in the drug to blacks and Hispanics.“I didn’t use racially charged language,” Mr. LePage claimed, although he also said, “Let’s leave ethnicity out of it.”",center

"WASHINGTON — House Democrats on Wednesday rejected appeals that they need new leaders to win back disaffected voters, re-electing Representative Nancy Pelosi of California to an eighth term as House leader over a Rust Belt congressman who said the party had lost its connection to the American working class.Ms. Pelosi’s victory over Representative Tim Ryan, a 43-year-old congressman from a blue-collar district anchored in Youngstown, Ohio, ensures that the party will be led in the next Congress by the established “coastal” Democrats who have increasingly defined it — Ms. Pelosi, 76, who represents San Francisco, and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, 66, who has held various leadership posts since 2005.The leadership elections, conducted by secret ballot behind closed doors, stamped out calls for new leaders.“I think there’s a lot of soul-searching,” said Representative Carolyn B. Maloney of New York.For years, support for Ms. Pelosi has run so deep that few would even consider challenging her.Ms. Pelosi, whose victory was mockingly cheered by Republicans as good news for them, dismissed the idea that House Democrats could no longer win with her at the helm.“We know how to win elections,” Ms. Pelosi said.Representative Kurt Schrader of Oregon, who backed Mr. Ryan, said after the vote that unless Democrats changed course and adopted “a working man and woman’s agenda,” they should expect defeat.“I’m very worried we just signed the Democratic Party’s death certificate for the next decade and a half,” Mr. Schrader said.Democrats also re-elected Representative Steny H. Hoyer, 77, of Maryland as whip, the No. 2 position, as well as Representative James E. Clyburn, 76, of South Carolina in the No. 3 spot as the assistant Democratic leader.Representative Joseph Crowley of New York was also elected chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, and in a narrow victory, 98 to 96, Representative Linda T. Sánchez of California defeated another California Democrat, Representative Barbara Lee, to become vice chairwoman.After a dismal Election Day for Democrats, the fight for Ms. Pelosi’s post had become a proxy battle for the future of the party, with House Democrats agonizing over how to reconnect with the working-class voters who abandoned them.“We got wiped out in the Midwest, and we’re toxic in rural America,” aides said Mr. Ryan told his colleagues behind closed doors before the vote.But in an interview Tuesday, Mr. Ryan suggested few ideas for how to appeal to voters beyond essentially crowdsourcing the task to more House Democrats, and he offered no indication that working with the Republican majority on any particular policy compromises would be a priority.The Democratic leaders seemed short on concrete strategies, too, committing generally to refocus their message on economic issues.Some of the more specific strategies considered included starting a more aggressive recruitment campaign for Democratic candidates from more conservative areas, as well as increasing their outreach to traditionally “red” districts.“Just because you’re only getting 30 percent of the vote in some area doesn’t mean you shouldn’t go there,” said Representative Cedric L. Richmond of Louisiana.Disappointed by the outcome of the leadership election, a handful of Democrats who had backed Mr. Ryan vowed to press forward with a proposal to turn some jobs, such as the chairman of the party’s campaign arm, into elected positions.That plan is expected to meet resistance from Ms. Pelosi, who retains the power to appoint people to those positions, though some Democrats have expressed an interest in the idea.Though he collected only a dozen or so public endorsements, Mr. Ryan mounted an unlikely challenge to Ms. Pelosi, long considered a legislative and fund-raising powerhouse.Trying to quell calls to replace her, Ms. Pelosi announced her nominations last week for a handful of other positions, and proposed that three members from Illinois, Pennsylvania and New York share the leadership duties of the party’s messaging committee, offering more regional diversity.But each new idea has underscored the fact that Ms. Pelosi refuses to relinquish much power and has cultivated a large, loyal following that does not expect her to.“She has a lot of friends,” Mr. Ryan said.",center
"Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg hasn’t been shy in recent days about the prospect of a Donald Trump presidency, joking that she might move to New Zealand if it ever happens.“I can’t imagine what this place would be ― I can’t imagine what the country would be ― with Donald Trump as our president,” Ginsburg told The New York Times in an article published Sunday.That tracks a comment she made in a separate interview with The Associated Press, when the justice stopped short of noting she’d rather have presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton making future appointments to the Supreme Court.“I don’t want to think about that possibility,” Ginsburg said when asked to consider Trump in the role of appointer-in-chief. Now a number of legal academics and Supreme Court observers are raising questions about the propriety of Ginsburg’s candor and what it might mean for the court’s integrity ― with some suggesting she might have to recuse herself from considering any Trump-related case that reaches the high court.“The other justices should hold an intervention, and tell her to be quiet or step down,” wrote Josh Blackman, a Houston College of Law professor who frequently writes about the high court.Rick Hasen, another avid court watcher who specializes in election law, wrote that Ginsburg’s statements could very well lead a “reasonable person” to question her impartiality in a future politically charged case.“I think this is ultimately a question for judicial ethicists, but I do think following these comments it is a legitimate question to raise, should Donald Trump’s campaign come to the Court with any legal questions before the election,” he wrote in his widely read Election Law Blog.Dmitry Bam, a professor at the University of Maine School of Law who has written on judicial recusals and ethics, said “there is little question that she has crossed a line.”“For a court that cares a great deal about appearances, this certainly creates the appearance that justices take sides in elections,” Bam wrote in an email.Under federal law, justices must step aside from cases where their “impartiality might reasonably be questioned” ― and they did so in 180 cases during the court’s last term, according to a new analysis by Fix the Court, a group that pushes for structural reform at the Supreme Court.Fix the Court found that the bulk of recent recusals were due to the justices’ prior work as appellate judges or in government positions.But recusals for political views or implicit support for certain positions are exceedingly rare, even in the face of a code of judicial conduct that guides federal judges on extra-judicial activities and how to avoid even the appearance of impropriety.Even with that guidance and other self-imposed checks in place, the justices have time and again declined to step aside in cases of high political salience ― most recently in the same-sex marriage cases, where Ginsburg and Justices Elena Kagan and Clarence Thomas all took part despite calls for them to recuse.“I’m not aware [that] any justice before has ever commented on the merits or demerits of a presidential candidate,” said Ed Whelan, the president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center and a frequent contributor to the conservative National Review Online, where he has chronicled this episode and what he deems Ginsburg’s “remarkable record of indiscretions.”“I may very well share her concerns about Donald Trump ... but the ethics concerns don’t depend on the soundness or unsoundness of the candidate,” Whelan added.But what if this is less a question about ethics and more about wanting our judges to be candid about their positions and biases ― and that the political process itself has done away with the veneer that the high court is entirely apolitical?“Most people now recognize that judges are heavily influenced by their personal beliefs and experiences,” said Bam, of the Maine School of Law.“We have watched one party refuse to hold hearings based the politics of the president and his potential nominees.",liberal
"PHILADELPHIA ― Americans should vote for Hillary Clinton because, unlike Republican nominee Donald Trump, she is a “sane, competent person,” Michael Bloomberg, the former New York mayor and founder of the Bloomberg financial news and information empire, said at the Democratic National Convention Wednesday.The line was an unscripted addition to a speech in which Bloomberg criticized Democrats, but argued that Trump was a “dangerous demagogue” and a bad businessman who would be a disastrous president.The billionaire ex-Republican, who has endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, made the case that Trump’s career is characterized by a litany of collapses and missteps, and that the Republican presidential nominee’s boasts don’t match reality.“Throughout his career, Trump has left behind a well-documented record of bankruptcies, thousands of lawsuits, angry stockholders and contractors who feel cheated and disillusioned customers who feel ripped off,” Bloomberg said.Bloomberg’s scathing speech seemed designed to chafe Trump’s rawest nerves, mocking Trump’s business prowess, his inheritance from his late father, his ego and his intellect.“Truth be told, the richest thing about Donald Trump is his hypocrisy,” Bloomberg said.Bloomberg ― who rivals Trump in unwavering self-assurance ― favorably compared his own achievements in business and politics with Trump’s.“We’ve heard a lot of talk in this campaign about needing a leader who understands business.Bloomberg weighed an independent bid for president this year because he objected to both Trump and Sen.

"Congress on Wednesday overwhelmingly rejected President Obama’s veto of a bipartisan bill letting families of Sept. 11 victims sue the Saudi Arabian government, in the first successful veto override of Obama’s presidency.Marking a significant defeat for the White House, the House ensured the bill will become law after voting 348-77 to override Wednesday afternoon.Despite last-ditch warnings from the Obama administration that the legislation could hurt national security and was “badly misguided,” lawmakers dismissed the concerns.""This bill is about respecting the voices and rights of American victims,"" Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said.Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., speaking on the Senate floor moments before Wednesday's vote in that chamber, pushed back hard on Saudi government objections to the legislation.“It’s very simple.Lawmakers in both chambers needed to muster a two-thirds majority to override, and did so easily.With elections just over a month away, many lawmakers were reluctant to oppose a measure backed by 9/11 families who say they are still seeking justice 15 years after the attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people.Despite an expectation that Congress would override, the White House made a last-ditch attempt to fight it.""As a result, our nation and its armed forces, State Department, intelligence officials and others may find themselves subject to lawsuits in foreign courts.""But Cornyn, one of the bill's leading proponents, dismissed Obama's concerns as ""unpersuasive.""The Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, or JASTA, moved to the floor of the Senate in May and passed by voice vote.Defense Secretary Ash Carter, in a letter Monday to a senior member of Congress, said he's sympathetic to the intent of the measure.With the override, the bill will now become law.The legislation gives victims' families the right to sue in U.S. court for any role that elements of the Saudi government may have played in the 2001 attacks.Courts would be permitted to waive a claim of foreign sovereign immunity when an act of terrorism occurs inside U.S. borders, according to the terms of the bill.Obama vetoed the measure last week, telling lawmakers the bill would make the U.S. vulnerable to retaliatory litigation in foreign courts that could put U.S. troops in legal jeopardy.But the bill's proponents have disputed Obama's rationale as ""unconvincing and unsupportable,"" saying the measure is narrowly tailored and applies only to acts of terrorism that occur on U.S. soil.Kristen Breitweiser, a 9/11 widow and co-chair of September 11th Advocates, criticized Carter's assessment, saying that the defense secretary had testified before Congress last week that he wasn't an expert on the bill.",center
"The terror massacre at a packed Orlando nightclub reverberated across the presidential campaign trail Sunday, as the candidates condemned the deadliest shooting in U.S. history -- and Donald Trump ripped President Obama and Hillary Clinton for avoiding the term “radical Islam” in doing so.The presumptive Republican presidential nominee went so far as to say Obama should “step down” for not using the term and Clinton should “get out of this race” if she won’t either.“If we do not get tough and smart real fast, we are not going to have a country anymore,” Trump said in a statement.Obama, speaking from the White House on Sunday, said the nightclub massacre in which 50 people were killed and at least 53 others were wounded is being investigated as an “act of terror,” though did not say whether it was tied to radical Islam.The gunman, Omar Mir Seddique Mateen, was heard shouting “Allahu Akbar” while engaging officers, law enforcement sources told Fox News.Mateen also called 911 during the shooting to pledge allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, Fox News has learned.ISIS reportedly claimed responsibility for the attack, though it’s unclear if the shooting was actually directed by the group or only inspired by it.All these details, surrounding the deadliest terror attack on the U.S. homeland since 9/11, have fueled tensions in the presidential race at an already-combustible time.Trump has faced intense criticism from members of both parties for his calls to temporarily ban Muslim immigration to the U.S.In the wake of the Orlando attack, Trump again defended his proposals, saying on Twitter: “What has happened in Orlando is just the beginning.Trump originally was planning to deliver a speech Monday in Manchester, N.H., focused on the Clintons.In the wake of the Orlando attack, it will also focus on security and immigration issues, Fox News is told.Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders also condemned the attack, while speaking to reporters outside his home in Burlington, Vt.Earlier Sunday, Clinton released a statement unequivocally calling the massacre an “act of terror.”“For now, we can say for certain that we need to redouble our efforts to defend our country from threats at home and abroad.She also called it an “act of hate” -- a term Obama also used -- since the attacker targeted an LGBT nightclub during Pride Month.Clinton did not reference radical Islam.Meanwhile, a joint campaign rally with Clinton and Obama set for Wednesday in Green Bay, Wis., has been postponed in light of the attack, according to a White House official.Obama also ordered U.S. flags to be flown at half-staff “as a mark of respect for the victims of the act of hatred and terror perpetrated on Sunday, June 12, 2016, in Orlando, Florida.”Florida GOP Gov. Rick Scott declared a state of emergency, which will make additional resources available for local authorities.He offered “thoughts and prayers” to all those affected by the attack, particularly the victims and their families, and praised the efforts of the first-responders.",liberal
"Even before Donald Trump landed in Mexico Wednesday, he found himself in a Twitter war with former Mexican President Vicente Fox – who went on a tear declaring the Republican nominee “not welcome” in the country.Fox, an outspoken critic of Trump, started the fight when he said on CNN that he disagreed with current President Enrique Pena Nieto’s decision to invite the billionaire to the country to meet with him.“He is not welcome to Mexico,” Fox told CNN.""I think President Peña is taking an enormous political risk by hosting Trump,” he said.Trump, as is often his way, fired back on Twitter.“Former President Vicente Fox, who is railing against my visit to Mexico today, also invited me when he apologized for using the ‘f bomb,’” he said, referring to when Fox said he wasn't going to pay for ""that f-----g wall.""This triggered a fiery response from Fox, also on Twitter, as he called on Trump to apologize and ""stop lying.""",center
"WASHINGTON ― In a stinging blow to President Barack Obama, the Senate voted Wednesday to override his veto of a bill to let 9/11 victims sue Saudi Arabia for its alleged role in the terrorist attacks.It’s the first time a chamber of Congress has had the votes to overrule Obama on a veto.“This is pretty much close to a miraculous occurrence,” Cornyn said before the vote.It takes two-thirds of the Senate to override a veto.A Kaine spokesman later told HuffPost that the senator was traveling during the vote, but had he been there, he would have voted to sustain the veto.The House voted later on Wednesday to override the veto, causing the bill to become law.The bill, known as the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, prevents Saudi Arabia and other countries with alleged ties to terrorist groups from invoking their legal immunity in U.S. courts.Fifteen of the 19 hijackers on 9/11 were Saudi citizens, but the Saudi government denies any role in the attacks and multiple U.S. government investigations have cleared it of blame.“I deeply respect the president and the reasons he has given for vetoing the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said ahead of the vote.The White House has fought against the bill for months, to no avail.But those arguments didn’t sway lawmakers, who say the White House’s case is overblown.“The bill is near and dear to my heart as a New Yorker because it would allow the victims of 9/11 to pursue some small measure of justice,” Schumer said Wednesday.Obama vetoed the bill last week and issued a lengthy statement with it.White House press secretary Josh Earnest last week downplayed the significance of Obama getting such a strong rebuke from Congress, including from Democratic leaders.“The president is not particularly concerned about that,” Earnest said in his Friday briefing.",conservative
